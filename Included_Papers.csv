Y,,BMJ,Weight regain after cessation of medication for weight management: systematic review and meta-analysis.,2026 Jan 7,10.1136/bmj-2025-085304 e085304,41500720,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify and compare the rate of weight regain after cessation of weight management medications (WMMs) in adults with overweight or obesity. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. STUDY SELECTION: Trial registries and databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, and trial registries) were searched from inception until February 2025 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised trials, and observational studies that included WMM (>/=8 weeks) with follow-up for >/=4 weeks after cessation of treatment in adults with overweight or obesity. Comparators were any non-drug weight loss intervention or placebo. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Two independent reviewers screened titles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised trials. Data were analysed using mixed effect, meta-regression, and time-to-event models. Weight regain after cessation of WMM was compared with that reported after cessation of behavioural weight management programmes (BWMPs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was rate of weight regain from end of treatment, with associated changes in cardiometabolic markers as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Of the 9288 titles screened, 37 studies (63 intervention arms, 9341 participants) were included. Average treatment duration was 39 (range 11-176) weeks, with average follow-up of 32 (4-104) weeks. The average monthly rate of weight regain was 0.4 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3 to 0.5) (mixed model 0.3 kg (0.2 to 0.4) monthly v control in RCTs). All cardiometabolic markers were projected to return to baseline within 1.4 years after the cessation of WMM. Weight regain was faster after WMM than after BWMP (by 0.3 kg (0.22 to 0.34) monthly), independent of initial weight loss. Estimates and precision were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This review found that cessation of WMM is followed by rapid weight regain and reversal of beneficial effects on cardiometabolic markers. Regain after WMM was faster than after BWMP. These findings suggest caution in short term use of these drugs without a more comprehensive approach to weight management.

Y,,BMJ,Effects of lifestyle interventions in pregnancy on gestational diabetes: individual participant data and network meta-analysis.,2026 Jan 6,10.1136/bmj-2025-084159 e084159,41494781,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of lifestyle interventions on gestational diabetes, determine whether the effects vary by maternal body mass index, age, parity, ethnicity, education level, or intervention, and rank interventions by effectiveness. DESIGN: Individual participant data (IPD) and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Major electronic databases (January 1990 to April 2025). METHODS: This meta-analysis included randomised trials on the effects of lifestyle interventions (physical activity based, diet based, or mixed) in pregnancy on gestational diabetes. Main outcomes were gestational diabetes defined by any criteria and by UK NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) criteria; other outcomes included IADPSG (International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group) and modified IADPSG defined gestational diabetes. A two stage IPD meta-analysis estimated summary odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals and interactions (subgroup effects), along with absolute risk reduction estimates. Aggregate data from non-IPD trials were added to the meta-analysis when possible. Intervention effects were ranked using network meta-analysis. RESULTS: 104 randomised trials (35 993 women) were included, with IPD for 68% of participants (24 391 women; 54 studies). Lifestyle interventions reduced gestational diabetes defined by any criteria by 10% in IPD trials (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.02; absolute risk reduction 1.3%, 95% CI -0.3% to 2.6%), and by 20% when combining IPD and non-IPD trials (odds ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88; absolute risk reduction 2.6%, 95% CI 1.6% to 3.6%), and no reduction was observed using NICE criteria (odds ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.84to 1.13). Lifestyle interventions reduced gestational diabetes defined using IADPSG criteria by 14% in IPD trials (odds ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; absolute risk reduction 2.7%, 95% CI 0.6% to 5.0%) and by 18% when combining IPD and non-IPD trials (odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.93; absolute risk reduction 3.5%, 95% CI 1.3% to 5.7%). Effects did not vary by maternal characteristics, except for education. Although women of all educational levels benefited from the intervention, the benefit was less in those with low education (low v middle interaction: odds ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90; low v high interaction: odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.93). Benefits did not vary by intervention characteristics, except for greater effectiveness with group format (odds ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97; absolute risk reduction 2.5%, 95% CI 0.4% to 4.3%) and newly trained facilitators (odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.96; absolute risk reduction 2.4%, 95% CI 0.5% to 4.2%). Physical activity based interventions ranked highest (mean rank 1.1, 95% CI 1 to 2) in preventing gestational diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle interventions in pregnancy are likely to prevent gestational diabetes, with effects varying according to diagnostic criteria. Implementation strategies should address inequalities by maternal education, and consider group formats, provider training, and physical activity based interventions to prevent gestational diabetes.

Y,,BMJ,Effect of the HPV vaccination programme on incidence of cervical cancer and grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by socioeconomic deprivation in England: population based observational study.,2024 May 15,10.1136/bmj-2023-077341 e077341,38749552,"OBJECTIVES: To replicate previous analyses on the effectiveness of the English human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme on incidence of cervical cancer and grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) using 12 additional months of follow-up, and to investigate effectiveness across levels of socioeconomic deprivation. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 20-64 years resident in England between January 2006 and June 2020 including 29 968 with a diagnosis of cervical cancer and 335 228 with a diagnosis of CIN3. In England, HPV vaccination was introduced nationally in 2008 and was offered routinely to girls aged 12-13 years, with catch-up campaigns during 2008-10 targeting older teenagers aged <19 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of invasive cervical cancer and CIN3. RESULTS: In England, 29 968 women aged 20-64 years received a diagnosis of cervical cancer and 335 228 a diagnosis of CIN3 between 1 January 2006 and 30 June 2020. In the birth cohort of women offered vaccination routinely at age 12-13 years, adjusted age standardised incidence rates of cervical cancer and CIN3 in the additional 12 months of follow-up (1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020) were, respectively, 83.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 63.8% to 92.8%) and 94.3% (92.6% to 95.7%) lower than in the reference cohort of women who were never offered HPV vaccination. By mid-2020, HPV vaccination had prevented an estimated 687 (95% CI 556 to 819) cervical cancers and 23 192 (22 163 to 24 220) CIN3s. The highest rates remained among women living in the most deprived areas, but the HPV vaccination programme had a large effect in all five levels of deprivation. In women offered catch-up vaccination, CIN3 rates decreased more in those from the least deprived areas than from the most deprived areas (reductions of 40.6% v 29.6% and 72.8% v 67.7% for women offered vaccination at age 16-18 and 14-16, respectively). The strong downward gradient in cervical cancer incidence from high to low deprivation in the reference unvaccinated group was no longer present among those offered the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The high effectiveness of the national HPV vaccination programme previously seen in England continued during the additional 12 months of follow-up. HPV vaccination was associated with a substantially reduced incidence of cervical cancer and CIN3 across all five deprivation groups, especially in women offered routine vaccination.",【观察性研究】显示，英格兰HPV疫苗接种计划显著降低了所有社会经济水平女性的宫颈癌及CIN3发病率，尤其在常规接种队列中效果突出。,2024-05-15,2024.0
Y,,BMJ,"Current safeguards, risk mitigation, and transparency measures of large language models against the generation of health disinformation: repeated cross sectional analysis.",2024 Mar 20,10.1136/bmj-2023-078538 e078538,38508682,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of safeguards to prevent large language models (LLMs) from being misused to generate health disinformation, and to evaluate the transparency of artificial intelligence (AI) developers regarding their risk mitigation processes against observed vulnerabilities. DESIGN: Repeated cross sectional analysis. SETTING: Publicly accessible LLMs. METHODS: In a repeated cross sectional analysis, four LLMs (via chatbots/assistant interfaces) were evaluated: OpenAI's GPT-4 (via ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot), Google's PaLM 2 and newly released Gemini Pro (via Bard), Anthropic's Claude 2 (via Poe), and Meta's Llama 2 (via HuggingChat). In September 2023, these LLMs were prompted to generate health disinformation on two topics: sunscreen as a cause of skin cancer and the alkaline diet as a cancer cure. Jailbreaking techniques (ie, attempts to bypass safeguards) were evaluated if required. For LLMs with observed safeguarding vulnerabilities, the processes for reporting outputs of concern were audited. 12 weeks after initial investigations, the disinformation generation capabilities of the LLMs were re-evaluated to assess any subsequent improvements in safeguards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were whether safeguards prevented the generation of health disinformation, and the transparency of risk mitigation processes against health disinformation. RESULTS: Claude 2 (via Poe) declined 130 prompts submitted across the two study timepoints requesting the generation of content claiming that sunscreen causes skin cancer or that the alkaline diet is a cure for cancer, even with jailbreaking attempts. GPT-4 (via Copilot) initially refused to generate health disinformation, even with jailbreaking attempts-although this was not the case at 12 weeks. In contrast, GPT-4 (via ChatGPT), PaLM 2/Gemini Pro (via Bard), and Llama 2 (via HuggingChat) consistently generated health disinformation blogs. In September 2023 evaluations, these LLMs facilitated the generation of 113 unique cancer disinformation blogs, totalling more than 40 000 words, without requiring jailbreaking attempts. The refusal rate across the evaluation timepoints for these LLMs was only 5% (7 of 150), and as prompted the LLM generated blogs incorporated attention grabbing titles, authentic looking (fake or fictional) references, fabricated testimonials from patients and clinicians, and they targeted diverse demographic groups. Although each LLM evaluated had mechanisms to report observed outputs of concern, the developers did not respond when observations of vulnerabilities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that although effective safeguards are feasible to prevent LLMs from being misused to generate health disinformation, they were inconsistently implemented. Furthermore, effective processes for reporting safeguard problems were lacking. Enhanced regulation, transparency, and routine auditing are required to help prevent LLMs from contributing to the mass generation of health disinformation.",【重复横断面分析】发现多数大语言模型易生成健康虚假信息，且报告漏洞机制无效，提示需加强监管与审计以防范临床信息风险。,2024-03-20,2024.0
Y,,BMJ,Invasive breast cancer and breast cancer death after non-screen detected ductal carcinoma in situ from 1990 to 2018 in England: population based cohort study.,2024 Jan 24,10.1136/bmj-2023-075498 e075498,38267073,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long term risks of invasive breast cancer and death related to breast cancer after non-screen detected ductal carcinoma in situ. Risks for women in the general population and for women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ via the screening programme were compared. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Data from the National Disease Registration Service. PARTICIPANTS: All 27 543 women in England who were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, outside the NHS breast screening programme, during 1990 to 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident invasive breast cancer and death caused by breast cancer. RESULTS: By 31 December 2018, 3651 women with non-screen detected ductal carcinoma in situ had developed invasive breast cancer, more than four times higher than expected from national cancer incidence rates (ratio of observed to expected rate was 4.21 (95% conference interval 4.07 to 4.35)). The ratio of observed to expected rate of developing invasive breast cancer remained increased throughout follow-up among women aged <45-70 years. The 25 year cumulative risks of invasive breast cancer by age at diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ were 27.3% for <45 years, 25.2% for 45-49 years, 21.7% for 50-59 years, and 20.8% for 60-70 years. 908 women died of breast cancer, almost four times higher than that expected from breast cancer death rates in the general population (ratio of observed to expected rate 3.83 (3.59 to 4.09)). The ratio of observed to expected rate of mortality attributed to breast cancer remained increased throughout follow-up. The 25 year cumulative risks of breast cancer death by age at ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosis were 7.6% for <45 years, 5.8% for 45-49 years, 5.9% for 50-59 years, and 6.2% for 60-70 years. Among women aged 50-64 years, and therefore eligible for breast screening by the NHS, the ratio of observed to expected rate of invasive breast cancer in women with non-screen detected compared with screen detected ductal carcinoma in situ was 1.26 (95% conference interval 1.17 to 1.35), while the ratio for mortality from breast cancer was 1.37 (1.17 to 1.60). Among 22 753 women with unilateral ductal carcinoma in situ undergoing surgery, those who had mastectomy rather than breast conserving surgery had a lower 25 year cumulative rate of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer (mastectomy 8.2% (95% conference interval 7.0% to 9.4%), breast conserving surgery with radiotherapy 19.8% (16.2% to 23.4%), and breast conserving surgery with no radiotherapy recorded 20.6% (18.7% to 22.4%)). However, reductions did not translate into a lower 25 year cumulative rate of deaths attributable to breast cancer (mastectomy 6.5% (4.9% to 10.9%), breast conserving surgery with radiotherapy 8.6% (5.9% to 15.5%), breast conserving surgery with no radiotherapy recorded 7.8% (6.3% to 11.5%)). CONCLUSIONS: For at least 25 years after their diagnosis, women with non-screen detected ductal carcinoma in situ had higher long term risks of invasive breast cancer and breast cancer death than women in the general population. Additionally, they had higher long term risks than women with screen detected ductal carcinoma in situ. Mastectomy was associated with lower risks of invasive breast cancer than breast conserving surgery, even when accompanied by radiotherapy. However, risks of breast cancer death appeared similar for mastectomy, breast conserving surgery with radiotherapy, and breast conserving surgery with no radiotherapy recorded.",【回顾性队列】研究发现，非筛查检出的导管原位癌患者长期浸润性乳腺癌发病及死亡风险显著高于普通人群及筛查检出者，提示需加强此类患者长期监测。,2024-01-24,2024.0
Y,,BMJ,"Association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and healthcare contacts for menstrual disturbance and bleeding in women before and after menopause: nationwide, register based cohort study.",2023 May 3,10.1136/bmj-2023-074778 e074778,37137493,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risks of any menstrual disturbance and bleeding following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in women who are premenopausal or postmenopausal. DESIGN: A nationwide, register based cohort study. SETTING: All inpatient and specialised outpatient care in Sweden from 27 December 2020 to 28 February 2022. A subset covering primary care for 40% of the Swedish female population was also included. PARTICIPANTS: 2 946 448 Swedish women aged 12-74 years were included. Pregnant women, women living in nursing homes, and women with history of any menstruation or bleeding disorders, breast cancer, cancer of female genital organs, or who underwent a hysterectomy between 1 January 2015 and 26 December 2020 were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, by vaccine product (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)) and dose (unvaccinated and first, second, and third dose) over two time windows (one to seven days, considered the control period, and 8-90 days). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare contact (admission to hospital or visit) for menstrual disturbance or bleeding before or after menopause (diagnosed with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes N91, N92, N93, N95). RESULTS: 2 580 007 (87.6%) of 2 946 448 women received at least one SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and 1 652 472 (64.0%) 2 580 007 of vaccinated women received three doses before the end of follow-up. The highest risks for bleeding in women who were postmenopausal were observed after the third dose, in the one to seven days risk window (hazard ratio 1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.62)) and in the 8-90 days risk window (1.25 (1.04 to 1.50)). The impact of adjustment for covariates was modest. Risk of postmenopausal bleeding suggested a 23-33% increased risk after 8-90 days with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 after the third dose, but the association with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was less clear. For menstrual disturbance or bleeding in women who were premenopausal, adjustment for covariates almost completely removed the weak associations noted in the crude analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Weak and inconsistent associations were observed between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and healthcare contacts for bleeding in women who are postmenopausal, and even less evidence was recorded of an association for menstrual disturbance or bleeding in women who were premenopausal. These findings do not provide substantial support for a causal association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and healthcare contacts related to menstrual or bleeding disorders.",【全国性回顾性队列研究】发现，新冠疫苗接种与绝经后女性因出血就医风险微弱相关，与绝经前女性月经紊乱就医无明显关联，不支持疫苗接种与月经/出血障碍存在强因果关系。,2023-05-03,2023.0

DESIGN: Population based observational cohort study. SETTING: Routinely collected data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. PARTICIPANTS: All 512 447 women registered with early invasive breast cancer (involving only breast and possibly axillary nodes) in England during January 1993 to December 2015, with follow-up to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual breast cancer mortality rates and cumulative risks by time since diagnosis, calendar period of diagnosis, and nine characteristics of patients and tumours. RESULTS: For women with a diagnosis made within each of the calendar periods 1993-99, 2000-04, 2005-09, and 2010-15, the crude annual breast cancer mortality rate was highest during the five years after diagnosis and then declined. For any given time since diagnosis, crude annual breast cancer mortality rates and risks decreased with increasing calendar period. Crude five year breast cancer mortality risk was 14.4% (95% confidence interval 14.2% to 14.6%) for women with a diagnosis made during 1993-99 and 4.9% (4.8% to 5.0%) for women with a diagnosis made during 2010-15. Adjusted annual breast cancer mortality rates also decreased with increasing calendar period in nearly every patient group, by a factor of about three in oestrogen receptor positive disease and about two in oestrogen receptor negative disease. Considering just the women with a diagnosis made during 2010-15, cumulative five year breast cancer mortality risk varied substantially between women with different characteristics: it was <3% for 62.8% (96 085/153 006) of women but >/=20% for 4.6% (6962/153 006) of women. CONCLUSIONS: These five year breast cancer mortality risks for patients with a recent diagnosis may be used to estimate breast cancer mortality risks for patients today. The prognosis for women with early invasive breast cancer has improved substantially since the 1990s. Most can expect to become long term cancer survivors, although for a few the risk remains appreciable.",【回顾性队列】研究显示，1993-2015年英格兰早期浸润性乳腺癌患者5年死亡率显著下降，预后改善明显，为当前患者风险评估提供重要参考。,2023-06-13,2023.0

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: British Columbia, Scotland, and England (England cohort consists of patients with cirrhosis only). PARTICIPANTS: 21 790 people who were successfully treated for hepatitis C in the era of interferon-free antivirals (2014-19). Participants were divided into three liver disease severity groups: people without cirrhosis (pre-cirrhosis), those with compensated cirrhosis, and those with end stage liver disease. Follow-up started 12 weeks after antiviral treatment completion and ended on date of death or 31 December 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude and age-sex standardised mortality rates, and standardised mortality ratio comparing the number of deaths with that of the general population, adjusting for age, sex, and year. Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated with all cause mortality rates. RESULTS: 1572 (7%) participants died during follow-up. The leading causes of death were drug related mortality (n=383, 24%), liver failure (n=286, 18%), and liver cancer (n=250, 16%). Crude all cause mortality rates (deaths per 1000 person years) were 31.4 (95% confidence interval 29.3 to 33.7), 22.7 (20.7 to 25.0), and 39.6 (35.4 to 44.3) for cohorts from British Columbia, Scotland, and England, respectively. All cause mortality was considerably higher than the rate for the general population across all disease severity groups and settings; for example, all cause mortality was three times higher among people without cirrhosis in British Columbia (standardised mortality ratio 2.96, 95% confidence interval 2.71 to 3.23; P<0.001) and more than 10 times higher for patients with end stage liver disease in British Columbia (13.61, 11.94 to 15.49; P<0.001). In regression analyses, older age, recent substance misuse, alcohol misuse, and comorbidities were associated with higher mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Mortality rates among people successfully treated for hepatitis C in the era of interferon-free, direct acting antivirals are high compared with the general population. Drug and liver related causes of death were the main drivers of excess mortality. These findings highlight the need for continued support and follow-up after successful treatment for hepatitis C to maximise the impact of direct acting antivirals.",【基于人群的队列研究】发现，无干扰素方案治愈的丙肝患者全因死亡率仍显著高于普通人群，主要死因为药物相关及肝脏疾病，提示治愈后仍需长期随访与综合管理。,2023-08-02,2023.0
Y,,JAMA,Clinical Validation of a Circulating Tumor DNA-Based Blood Test to Screen for Colorectal Cancer.,2025 Jul 1,10.1001/jama.2025.7515,40455622,"IMPORTANCE: Colorectal cancer screening is widely recommended but underused. Blood-based screening offers the potential for higher adherence compared with endoscopy or stool-based testing but must first be clinically validated in a screening population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical performance of an investigational blood-based circulating tumor DNA test for colorectal cancer detection in an average-risk population using colonoscopy with histopathology as the reference method. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional observational study enrolling participants between May 2020 and April 2022 who were asymptomatic adults aged 45 to 85 years, at average risk of colorectal cancer, and willing to undergo a standard-of-care screening colonoscopy. Participants, staff, and pathologists were blinded to blood test results, and laboratory testing was performed blinded to colonoscopy findings. The study was conducted at 201 centers across 49 US states and the United Arab Emirates. Site-based and mobile phlebotomy were used for blood collection. EXPOSURES: Participants were required to complete a screening colonoscopy after blood collection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end points were sensitivity for colorectal cancer, specificity for advanced colorectal neoplasia (colorectal cancer or advanced precancerous lesions), negative predictive value for advanced colorectal neoplasia, and positive predictive value for advanced colorectal neoplasia. The secondary end point was sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions. RESULTS: The median age of participants in the evaluable cohort (n = 27 010) was 57.0 years, and 55.8% were women. Sensitivity for colorectal cancer was 79.2% (57/72; 95% CI, 68.4%-86.9%) and specificity for advanced colorectal neoplasia was 91.5% (22 306/24 371; 95% CI, 91.2%-91.9%). The negative predictive value for advanced colorectal neoplasia was 90.8% (22 306/24 567; 95% CI, 90.7%-90.9%) and the positive predictive value for advanced colorectal neoplasia was 15.5% (378/2443; 95% CI, 14.2%-16.8%). All primary end points met prespecified acceptance criteria. The sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions was 12.5% (321/2567; 95% CI, 11.3%-13.8%), which did not meet the prespecified acceptance criterion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In an average-risk colorectal cancer screening population, a blood-based test demonstrated acceptable accuracy for colorectal cancer detection, but detection of advanced precancerous lesions remains a challenge, and ongoing efforts are needed to improve test sensitivity.

Y,,JAMA,Adenoma Detection Rates by Physicians and Subsequent Colorectal Cancer Risk.,2025 Feb 4,10.1001/jama.2024.22975,39680377,"IMPORTANCE: Patients of physicians with higher adenoma detection rates (ADRs) during colonoscopy have lower colorectal cancer (CRC) risk after screening colonoscopy (ie, postcolonoscopy CRC). Among physicians with an ADR above the recommended threshold, it is unknown whether improving ADR is associated with a lower incidence of CRC in their patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of improved ADR in physicians with a range of ADR values at baseline with CRC incidence among their patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 789 physicians in the Polish Colonoscopy Screening Program were studied between 2000 and 2017, with final follow-up on December 31, 2022. Joinpoint regression analyses were used to identify trends between changes in ADR and postcolonoscopy CRC incidence. Rates of CRC after colonoscopy were compared between physicians whose ADR improved and those without improvement. ADR improvement was defined as either an improvement by at least 1 ADR sextile category or remaining in the highest category. EXPOSURE: Physician ADR. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of improved ADR with postcolonoscopy CRC incidence. RESULTS: Of 485 615 patients (mean [SD] age, 57 [5.41] years; 60% female), 1873 CRC diagnoses and 474 CRC-related deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 10.2 years. Among individual physicians at baseline, median (IQR) ADR was 21.8% (15.9%-28.2%) and maximum ADR was 63.0%. Joinpoint regression showed a change in CRC incidence trends at an ADR level of 26%, corresponding to a CRC incidence of 27.1 per 100 000 person-years. Patients of physicians whose ADR was less than 26% at baseline and improved during follow-up had a postcolonoscopy CRC incidence of 31.8 (95% CI, 29.5-34.3) per 100 000 person-years, compared with 40.7 (95% CI, 37.8-43.8) per 100 000 person-years for patients of physicians with an ADR of less than 26% at baseline who did not improve during follow-up (difference, 8.9/100 000 person-years [95% CI, 5.06-12.74]; P < .001). Patients of physicians whose ADR was above 26% at baseline and improved during follow-up had a postcolonoscopy CRC incidence of 23.4 (95% CI, 18.4-29.8) per 100 000 person-years, compared with 22.5 (95% CI, 18.3-27.6) for patients of physicians whose ADR was above 26% at baseline and did not improve during follow-up (difference, 0.9/100 000 person-years [95% CI, -6.46 to 8.26]; P = .80). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this observational study, improved ADR over time was statistically significantly associated with lower CRC risk in patients who underwent colonoscopy compared with absence of ADR improvement, but only among patients whose physician had a baseline ADR of less than 26%.",【回顾性队列】研究发现，基线腺瘤检出率低于26%的医师若提高检出率，其患者结肠镜后结直肠癌风险显著降低，提示提升低水平医师操作质量具有临床价值。,2025-02-04,2025.0
Y,,JAMA,A Lay Health Worker-Led Symptom Intervention and Acute Care Use in Older Adults With Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,2025 Dec 30,10.1001/jama.2025.23403 e2523403,41468027,"IMPORTANCE: Undertreated cancer symptoms are common among older adults, yet effective early identification and intervention remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lay health worker-led symptom assessment reduces acute care use among older adults with cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multisite randomized clinical trial across 43 oncology clinics in California and Arizona conducted from November 2020 through October 2023 with 12 months of follow-up among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries aged 75 years or older with newly diagnosed, recurrent, or progressive cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 into a symptom assessment group (n = 200; usual care with lay health worker-led, telephone-based symptom assessments for 12 months using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System) or a control group (n = 216; usual care alone), with planned enrollment of 200 in both groups. The lay health workers reviewed assessments with advanced practice practitioners who conducted interventions for symptoms rated 4 or greater or that increased by 2 points or more. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were determined a priori. The primary outcome was emergency department (ED) use and hospitalizations. Secondary outcomes were total costs, hospice, and, among decedents, acute care within 30 days of death and facility deaths. RESULTS: Among 416 patients, the median age was 82 (range, 75-99) years; 219 (52.6%) were male; 171 (41.1%) had stage 4 disease; and 27 (6.4%) had recurrent disease. The mean risk adjustment factor score was 2.70 (SD, 1.77). Symptom assessment participants had 53% lower odds of ED use (61 [30.5%] vs 103 [47.7%] had >/=1 ED visit; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32-0.71), 68% lower odds of hospitalization (37 [18.5%] vs 86 [39.8%] had >/=1 hospitalization; OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51), and lower mean total costs by $12 000 per participant (P = .01) than control group participants. Among 142 deceased participants (71 in each group), symptom assessment participants had 68% lower odds of ED use within 30 days of death (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.88) and 75% lower odds of acute care facility death (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08-0.77). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A lay health worker-led symptom assessment intervention may be a scalable approach to reduce acute care use.

Y,,JAMA,Arsenic Exposure Reduction and Chronic Disease Mortality.,2025 Dec 16,10.1001/jama.2025.19161,41247717,"IMPORTANCE: Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water has been associated with increased chronic disease mortality. However, there is limited evidence on associations between reduced exposure and mortality risk. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether reductions in arsenic exposure, measured using urinary arsenic levels, are associated with lower mortality from chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort of 11 746 adults was enrolled between 2000 and 2002 in Araihazar, Bangladesh, with levels of well-water arsenic ranging from less than 1 microg/L to 864 microg/L (mean, 102 microg/L), exceeding the Bangladesh standard of 50 microg/L. Arsenic levels declined over time as a result of community mitigation. Mortality was tracked through 2022. Analyses included 10 977 participants with calculable changes in urinary arsenic levels. EXPOSURES: Urinary arsenic levels were measured up to 5 times per participant through 2018. Participants were categorized based on changes in urinary arsenic levels. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs for mortality from chronic diseases, including cancer and CVD. RESULTS: Among 10 977 participants (57% female; mean age, 37.0 [SD, 10.1] years), mean urinary arsenic levels declined from 283 (SD, 314) to 132 (SD, 161) microg/g creatinine from 2000 to 2018. Each IQR decrease in urinary arsenic (197 microg/g creatinine) was associated with 22% lower chronic disease mortality (aHR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.75-0.82]), 20% lower cancer mortality (aHR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.87]), and 23% lower CVD mortality (aHR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.73-0.81]). Time-varying Cox and restricted cubic spline analyses showed larger reductions were associated with lower mortality, while increases were linked to higher risk. Compared with participants with consistently high urinary arsenic levels (above the baseline median of 199 microg/g creatinine [n = 1757]), those whose levels declined below the median (n = 3757) had lower mortality from chronic diseases (aHR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.39-0.53]), including cancer (aHR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.35-0.73]) and CVD (aHR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.34-0.53]), similar to those consistently below the median (n = 4959) (aHR, 0.43-0.49). Findings were similar in propensity score-matched analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings support an association between reduced arsenic exposure and improved health outcomes in populations exposed to contaminated drinking water.",【前瞻性队列】研究发现，砷暴露降低与慢性病（癌症、心血管病）死亡风险下降显著相关，提示干预砷污染可改善人群健康。,2025-12-16,2025.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether risk-based breast cancer screening is a feasible alternative to annual mammography. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Parallel-group, pragmatic, multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing risk-based (n = 14 212) with annual (n = 14 160) breast cancer screening. Women aged 40 to 74 years without prior diagnoses of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, were recruited from all 50 US states from September 2016 to February 2023, with follow-up through September 5, 2025 (median follow-up, 5.1 years). Statistical analysis was conducted between July and November 2025. All study procedures were conducted via an online platform. Women who declined randomization were enrolled in an observational cohort. INTERVENTIONS: Risk assessment included sequencing of 9 susceptibility genes, polygenic risk score, and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium version 2 model. The risk-based group received 1 of 4 recommendations: (1) highest risk (>/=6% 5-year risk, high-penetrance pathogenic variant): alternating mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 6 months and counseling; (2) elevated risk (top 2.5 risk percentile by age): annual mammography and risk-reduction counseling; (3) average risk: biennial mammography; and (4) low risk (aged 40-49 years and <1.3% 5-year risk): no screening until risk is 1.3% or greater or age 50 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The coprimary outcomes included noninferiority for stage >/=IIB cancers and superiority in reducing biopsy rates. Secondary outcomes included identification of stage >/=IIA cancers, mammogram rates, uptake of prevention strategies in higher risk cohorts, preference for screening group in the observational cohort, ductal carcinoma in situ, MRI, and stage-specific cancer rates. RESULTS: A total of 28 372 women were randomized. The mean (SD) age was 54 (9.6) years and the majority were non-Hispanic White (77%). The rate of stage >/=IIB cancers was noninferior in the risk-based compared with the annual group (risk-based: 30.0 [95% CI, 16.3-43.8] vs annual: 48.0 [95% CI, 30.1-65.5] per 100 000 person-years; rate difference, -18.0 per 100 000 person-years [95% CI, -40.2 to 4.1]). The rate of breast biopsies was not lower in the risk-based group (rate difference, 98.7 per 100 000 person-years [95% CI, -17.9 to 215.3]) despite fewer mammograms (rate difference, -3835.9 [95% CI, -4516.8 to -3154.9]). The cumulative incidence of cancer, biopsy, mammogram, and MRI increased as risk category increased. In the observational cohort, 89% of participants (15 980/18 031) chose risk based. CONCLUSIONS: Risk-based breast cancer screening that includes population-based genetic testing safely stratified risk and screening intensity, but did not reduce biopsy rates.

Y,,JAMA,Germline CDH1 Variants and Lifetime Cancer Risk.,2024 Sep 3,10.1001/jama.2024.10852,38873722,"IMPORTANCE: Approximately 1% to 3% of gastric cancers and 5% of lobular breast cancers are hereditary. Loss of function CDH1 gene variants are the most common gene variants associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. Previously, the lifetime risk of gastric cancer was estimated to be approximately 25% to 83% and for breast cancer it was estimated to be approximately 39% to 55% in individuals with loss of function CDH1 gene variants. OBJECTIVE: To describe gastric and breast cancer risk estimates for individuals with CDH1 variants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, retrospective cohort and modeling study of 213 families from North America with a CDH1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant in 1 or more family members conducted between January 2021 and August 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs), defined as risk in variant carriers relative to noncarriers, were estimated for each cancer type and used to calculate cumulative risks and risks per decade of life up to age 80 years. RESULTS: A total of 7323 individuals from 213 families were studied, including 883 with a CDH1 P/LP variant (median proband age, 53 years [IQR, 42-62]; 4% Asian; 4% Hispanic; 85% non-Hispanic White; 50% female). In individuals with a CDH1 P/LP variant, the prevalence of gastric cancer was 13.9% (123/883) and the prevalence of breast cancer among female carriers was 26.3% (144/547). The estimated HR for advanced gastric cancer was 33.5 (95% CI, 9.8-112) at age 30 years and 3.5 (95% CI, 0.4-30.3) at age 70 years. The lifetime cumulative risk of advanced gastric cancer in male and female carriers was 10.3% (95% CI, 6%-23.6%) and 6.5% (95% CI, 3.8%-15.1%), respectively. Gastric cancer risk estimates based on family history indicated that a carrier with 3 affected first-degree relatives had a penetrance of approximately 38% (95% CI, 25%-64%). The HR for breast cancer among female carriers was 5.7 (95% CI, 2.5-13.2) at age 30 years and 3.9 (95% CI, 1.1-13.7) at age 70 years. The lifetime cumulative risk of breast cancer among female carriers was 36.8% (95% CI, 25.7%-62.9%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among families from North America with germline CDH1 P/LP variants, the cumulative risk of gastric cancer was 7% to 10%, which was lower than previously described, and the cumulative risk of breast cancer among female carriers was 37%, which was similar to prior estimates. These findings inform current management of individuals with germline CDH1 variants.",【回顾性队列】研究发现北美CDH1胚系变异携带者胃癌累积风险（7%-10%）低于既往，乳腺癌风险（37%）相似，为临床风险咨询提供新依据。,2024-09-03,2024.0
Y,,JAMA,Clinical Benefit and Regulatory Outcomes of Cancer Drugs Receiving Accelerated Approval.,2024 May 7,10.1001/jama.2024.2396,38583175,"IMPORTANCE: The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) accelerated approval pathway allows approval of investigational drugs treating unmet medical needs based on changes to surrogate measures considered ""reasonably likely"" to predict clinical benefit. Postapproval clinical trials are then required to confirm whether these drugs offer clinical benefit. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cancer drugs granted accelerated approval ultimately demonstrate clinical benefit and to evaluate the basis of conversion to regular approval. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, publicly available FDA data were used to identify cancer drugs granted accelerated approval from 2013 to 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Demonstrated improvement in quality of life or overall survival in accelerated approvals with more than 5 years of follow-up, as well as confirmatory trial end points and time to conversion for drug-indication pairs converted to regular approval. RESULTS: A total of 129 cancer drug-indication pairs were granted accelerated approval from 2013 to 2023. Among 46 indications with more than 5 years of follow-up (approved 2013-2017), approximately two-thirds (29, 63%) were converted to regular approval, 10 (22%) were withdrawn, and 7 (15%) remained ongoing after a median of 6.3 years. Fewer than half (20/46, 43%) demonstrated a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Time to withdrawal decreased from 9.9 years to 3.6 years, and time to regular approval increased from 1.6 years to 3.6 years. Among 48 drug-indication pairs converted to regular approval, 19 (40%) were converted based on overall survival, 21 (44%) on progression-free survival, 5 (10%) on response rate plus duration of response, 2 (4%) on response rate, and 1 (2%) despite a negative confirmatory trial. Comparing accelerated and regular approval indications, 18 of 48 (38%) were unchanged, while 30 of 48 (63%) had different indications (eg, earlier line of therapy). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most cancer drugs granted accelerated approval did not demonstrate benefit in overall survival or quality of life within 5 years of accelerated approval. Patients should be clearly informed about the cancer drugs that use the accelerated approval pathway and do not end up showing benefits in patient-centered clinical outcomes.",【回顾性队列】研究发现，2013-2023年获FDA加速批准的癌症药物中，随访超5年者仅43%在验证性试验中证实临床获益，提示需审慎看待该途径药物的临床价值。,2024-05-07,2024.0

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the long-term oncological outcomes of patients receiving active surveillance in a multicenter, protocol-directed cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS) is a prospective cohort study initiated in 2008. A cohort of 2155 men with favorable-risk prostate cancer and no prior treatment were enrolled at 10 North American centers through August 2022. EXPOSURE: Active surveillance for prostate cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of biopsy grade reclassification, treatment, metastasis, prostate cancer mortality, overall mortality, and recurrence after treatment in patients treated after the first or subsequent surveillance biopsies. RESULTS: Among 2155 patients with localized prostate cancer, the median follow-up was 7.2 years, median age was 63 years, 83% were White, 7% were Black, 90% were diagnosed with grade group 1 cancer, and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 5.2 ng/mL. Ten years after diagnosis, the incidence of biopsy grade reclassification and treatment were 43% (95% CI, 40%-45%) and 49% (95% CI, 47%-52%), respectively. There were 425 and 396 patients treated after confirmatory or subsequent surveillance biopsies (median of 1.5 and 4.6 years after diagnosis, respectively) and the 5-year rates of recurrence were 11% (95% CI, 7%-15%) and 8% (95% CI, 5%-11%), respectively. Progression to metastatic cancer occurred in 21 participants and there were 3 prostate cancer-related deaths. The estimated rates of metastasis or prostate cancer-specific mortality at 10 years after diagnosis were 1.4% (95% CI, 0.7%-2%) and 0.1% (95% CI, 0%-0.4%), respectively; overall mortality in the same time period was 5.1% (95% CI, 3.8%-6.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, 10 years after diagnosis, 49% of men remained free of progression or treatment, less than 2% developed metastatic disease, and less than 1% died of their disease. Later progression and treatment during surveillance were not associated with worse outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate outcomes of various mammography screening strategies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Comparison of outcomes using 6 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models and national data on breast cancer incidence, mammography performance, treatment effects, and other-cause mortality in US women without previous cancer diagnoses. EXPOSURES: Thirty-six screening strategies with varying start ages (40, 45, 50 years) and stop ages (74, 79 years) with digital mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) annually, biennially, or a combination of intervals. Strategies were evaluated for all women and for Black women, assuming 100% screening adherence and ""real-world"" treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated lifetime benefits (breast cancer deaths averted, percent reduction in breast cancer mortality, life-years gained), harms (false-positive recalls, benign biopsies, overdiagnosis), and number of mammograms per 1000 women. RESULTS: Biennial screening with DBT starting at age 40, 45, or 50 years until age 74 years averted a median of 8.2, 7.5, or 6.7 breast cancer deaths per 1000 women screened, respectively, vs no screening. Biennial DBT screening at age 40 to 74 years (vs no screening) was associated with a 30.0% breast cancer mortality reduction, 1376 false-positive recalls, and 14 overdiagnosed cases per 1000 women screened. Digital mammography screening benefits were similar to those for DBT but had more false-positive recalls. Annual screening increased benefits but resulted in more false-positive recalls and overdiagnosed cases. Benefit-to-harm ratios of continuing screening until age 79 years were similar or superior to stopping at age 74. In all strategies, women with higher-than-average breast cancer risk, higher breast density, and lower comorbidity level experienced greater screening benefits than other groups. Annual screening of Black women from age 40 to 49 years with biennial screening thereafter reduced breast cancer mortality disparities while maintaining similar benefit-to-harm trade-offs as for all women. CONCLUSIONS: This modeling analysis suggests that biennial mammography screening starting at age 40 years reduces breast cancer mortality and increases life-years gained per mammogram. More intensive screening for women with greater risk of breast cancer diagnosis or death can maintain similar benefit-to-harm trade-offs and reduce mortality disparities.",【决策分析模型研究】显示，40岁起每两年一次乳腺断层摄影筛查可降低30%乳腺癌死亡率，且对高风险人群获益更显著。,2024-06-11,2024.0

The incidence of stage III-IV cancer is a potential alternative end point that may accelerate completion of randomized clinical trials of cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: To compare cancer-specific mortality with stage III-IV cancer as end points in randomized clinical trials of cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This meta-analysis included 41 randomized clinical trials of cancer screening conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia published through February 19, 2024. Data extracted included numbers of participants, cancer diagnoses, and cancer deaths in the intervention and comparison groups. For each clinical trial, the effect of screening was calculated as the percentage reduction between the intervention and comparison groups in the incidence of participants with cancer-specific mortality and stage III-IV cancer. EXPOSURES: Randomization to a cancer screening test or to a comparison group in a clinical trial of cancer screening. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: End points of cancer-specific mortality and incidence of stage III-IV cancer were compared using Pearson correlation coefficients with 95% CIs, linear regression, and fixed-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The included randomized clinical trials tested benefits of screening for breast (n = 6), colorectal (n = 11), lung (n = 12), ovarian (n = 4), prostate (n = 4), and other cancers (n = 4). Correlation between reductions in cancer-specific mortality and stage III-IV cancer varied by cancer type (I2 = 65%; P = .02). Correlation was highest for trials that screened for ovarian (Pearson rho = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.51-1.00]) and lung (Pearson rho = 0.92 [95% CI, 0.72-0.98]) cancers, moderate for breast cancer (Pearson rho = 0.70 [95% CI, -0.26 to 0.96]), and weak for colorectal (Pearson rho = 0.39 [95% CI, -0.27 to 0.80]) and prostate (Pearson rho = -0.69 [95% CI, -0.99 to 0.81]) cancers. Slopes from linear regression were estimated as 1.15 for ovarian cancer, 0.75 for lung cancer, 0.40 for colorectal cancer, 0.28 for breast cancer, and -3.58 for prostate cancer, suggesting that a given magnitude of reduction in incidence of stage III-IV cancer produced different magnitudes of change in incidence of cancer-specific mortality (P for heterogeneity = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In randomized clinical trials of cancer screening, incidence of late-stage cancer may be a suitable alternative end point to cancer-specific mortality for some cancer types, but is not suitable for others. These results have implications for clinical trials of multicancer screening tests.",【系统综述与Meta分析】发现，在癌症筛查随机试验中，晚期癌症发生率替代癌症特异性死亡终点的适用性因癌种而异，对优化临床试验设计有重要价值。,2024-06-11,2024.0

Follow-up data were collected by questionnaire through February 1, 2022. EXPOSURES: Radical prostatectomy (n = 1043), external beam radiotherapy (n = 359), brachytherapy (n = 96), or active surveillance (n = 379) for favorable-prognosis disease and radical prostatectomy (n = 362) or external beam radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy (n = 206) for unfavorable-prognosis disease. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were patient-reported sexual, urinary, bowel, and hormone function measured using the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (range, 0-100; 100 = best). Associations of specific therapies with each outcome were estimated and compared at 10 years after treatment, adjusting for corresponding baseline scores, and patient and tumor characteristics. Minimum clinically important differences were 10 to 12 for sexual function, 6 to 9 for urinary incontinence, 5 to 7 for urinary irritation, and 4 to 6 for bowel and hormone function. RESULTS: A total of 2445 patients with localized prostate cancer (median age, 64 years; 14% Black, 8% Hispanic) were included and followed up for a median of 9.5 years. Among 1877 patients with favorable prognosis, radical prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence (adjusted mean difference, -12.1 [95% CI, -16.2 to -8.0]), but not worse sexual function (adjusted mean difference, -7.2 [95% CI, -12.3 to -2.0]), compared with active surveillance. Among 568 patients with unfavorable prognosis, radical prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence (adjusted mean difference, -26.6 [95% CI, -35.0 to -18.2]), but not worse sexual function (adjusted mean difference, -1.4 [95% CI, -11.1 to 8.3), compared with external beam radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy. Among patients with unfavorable prognosis, external beam radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy was associated with worse bowel (adjusted mean difference, -4.9 [95% CI, -9.2 to -0.7]) and hormone (adjusted mean difference, -4.9 [95% CI, -9.5 to -0.3]) function compared with radical prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients treated for localized prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence but not worse sexual function at 10-year follow-up compared with radiotherapy or surveillance among people with more favorable prognosis and compared with radiotherapy for those with unfavorable prognosis. Among men with unfavorable-prognosis disease, external beam radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy was associated with worse bowel and hormone function at 10-year follow-up compared with radical prostatectomy.",【回顾性队列研究】发现，局限性前列腺癌患者中，根治性前列腺切除术与更差的尿失禁相关，而放疗联合内分泌治疗则与更差的肠道及激素功能相关，为治疗选择提供了长期功能预后证据。,2024-01-23,2024.0
Y,,JAMA,Pregnancy After Breast Cancer in Young BRCA Carriers: An International Hospital-Based Cohort Study.,2024 Jan 2,10.1001/jama.2023.25463,38059899,"IMPORTANCE: Young women with breast cancer who have germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 face unique challenges regarding fertility. Previous studies demonstrating the feasibility and safety of pregnancy in breast cancer survivors included limited data regarding BRCA carriers. OBJECTIVE: To investigate cumulative incidence of pregnancy and disease-free survival in young women who are BRCA carriers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: International, multicenter, hospital-based, retrospective cohort study conducted at 78 participating centers worldwide. The study included female participants diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at age 40 years or younger between January 2000 and December 2020 carrying germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Last delivery was October 7, 2022; last follow-up was February 20, 2023. EXPOSURE: Pregnancy after breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points were cumulative incidence of pregnancy after breast cancer and disease-free survival. Secondary end points were breast cancer-specific survival, overall survival, pregnancy, and fetal and obstetric outcomes. RESULTS: Of 4732 BRCA carriers included, 659 had at least 1 pregnancy after breast cancer and 4073 did not. Median age at diagnosis in the overall cohort was 35 years (IQR, 31-38 years). Cumulative incidence of pregnancy at 10 years was 22% (95% CI, 21%-24%), with a median time from breast cancer diagnosis to conception of 3.5 years (IQR, 2.2-5.3 years). Among the 659 patients who had a pregnancy, 45 (6.9%) and 63 (9.7%) had an induced abortion or a miscarriage, respectively. Of the 517 patients (79.7%) with a completed pregnancy, 406 (91.0%) delivered at term (>/=37 weeks) and 54 (10.4%) had twins. Among the 470 infants born with known information on pregnancy complications, 4 (0.9%) had documented congenital anomalies. Median follow-up was 7.8 years (IQR, 4.5-12.6 years). No significant difference in disease-free survival was observed between patients with or without a pregnancy after breast cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.81-1.20). Patients who had a pregnancy had significantly better breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this global study, 1 in 5 young BRCA carriers conceived within 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis. Pregnancy following breast cancer in BRCA carriers was not associated with decreased disease-free survival.

Y,,JAMA,Analysis of Breast Cancer Mortality in the US-1975 to 2019.,2024 Jan 16,10.1001/jama.2023.25881,38227031,"IMPORTANCE: Breast cancer mortality in the US declined between 1975 and 2019. The association of changes in metastatic breast cancer treatment with improved breast cancer mortality is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To simulate the relative associations of breast cancer screening, treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and treatment of metastatic breast cancer with improved breast cancer mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using aggregated observational and clinical trial data on the dissemination and effects of screening and treatment, 4 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models simulated US breast cancer mortality rates. Death due to breast cancer, overall and by estrogen receptor and ERBB2 (formerly HER2) status, among women aged 30 to 79 years in the US from 1975 to 2019 was simulated. EXPOSURES: Screening mammography, treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and treatment of metastatic breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model-estimated age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate associated with screening, stage I to III treatment, and metastatic treatment relative to the absence of these exposures was assessed, as was model-estimated median survival after breast cancer metastatic recurrence. RESULTS: The breast cancer mortality rate in the US (age adjusted) was 48/100 000 women in 1975 and 27/100 000 women in 2019. In 2019, the combination of screening, stage I to III treatment, and metastatic treatment was associated with a 58% reduction (model range, 55%-61%) in breast cancer mortality. Of this reduction, 29% (model range, 19%-33%) was associated with treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 47% (model range, 35%-60%) with treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and 25% (model range, 21%-33%) with mammography screening. Based on simulations, the greatest change in survival after metastatic recurrence occurred between 2000 and 2019, from 1.9 years (model range, 1.0-2.7 years) to 3.2 years (model range, 2.0-4.9 years). Median survival for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/ERBB2-positive breast cancer improved by 2.5 years (model range, 2.0-3.4 years), whereas median survival for ER-/ERBB2- breast cancer improved by 0.5 years (model range, 0.3-0.8 years). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: According to 4 simulation models, breast cancer screening and treatment in 2019 were associated with a 58% reduction in US breast cancer mortality compared with interventions in 1975. Simulations suggested that treatment for stage I to III breast cancer was associated with approximately 47% of the mortality reduction, whereas treatment for metastatic breast cancer was associated with 29% of the reduction and screening with 25% of the reduction.",【模拟模型研究】显示，1975-2019年美国乳腺癌死亡率下降58%，其中I-III期治疗贡献最大（47%），转移性治疗（29%）和筛查（25%）次之。,2024-01-16,2024.0
Y,,JAMA,Long-Term Outcomes of Medical Management vs Bariatric Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes.,2024 Feb 27,10.1001/jama.2024.0318,38411644,"IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials of bariatric surgery have been limited in size, type of surgical procedure, and follow-up duration. OBJECTIVE: To determine long-term glycemic control and safety of bariatric surgery compared with medical/lifestyle management of type 2 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: ARMMS-T2D (Alliance of Randomized Trials of Medicine vs Metabolic Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes) is a pooled analysis from 4 US single-center randomized trials conducted between May 2007 and August 2013, with observational follow-up through July 2022. INTERVENTION: Participants were originally randomized to undergo either medical/lifestyle management or 1 of the following 3 bariatric surgical procedures: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric banding. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to 7 years for all participants. Data are reported for up to 12 years. RESULTS: A total of 262 of 305 eligible participants (86%) enrolled in long-term follow-up for this pooled analysis. The mean (SD) age of participants was 49.9 (8.3) years, mean (SD) body mass index was 36.4 (3.5), 68.3% were women, 31% were Black, and 67.2% were White. During follow-up, 25% of participants randomized to undergo medical/lifestyle management underwent bariatric surgery. The median follow-up was 11 years. At 7 years, HbA1c decreased by 0.2% (95% CI, -0.5% to 0.2%), from a baseline of 8.2%, in the medical/lifestyle group and by 1.6% (95% CI, -1.8% to -1.3%), from a baseline of 8.7%, in the bariatric surgery group. The between-group difference was -1.4% (95% CI, -1.8% to -1.0%; P < .001) at 7 years and -1.1% (95% CI, -1.7% to -0.5%; P = .002) at 12 years. Fewer antidiabetes medications were used in the bariatric surgery group. Diabetes remission was greater after bariatric surgery (6.2% in the medical/lifestyle group vs 18.2% in the bariatric surgery group; P = .02) at 7 years and at 12 years (0.0% in the medical/lifestyle group vs 12.7% in the bariatric surgery group; P < .001). There were 4 deaths (2.2%), 2 in each group, and no differences in major cardiovascular adverse events. Anemia, fractures, and gastrointestinal adverse events were more common after bariatric surgery. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: After 7 to 12 years of follow-up, individuals originally randomized to undergo bariatric surgery compared with medical/lifestyle intervention had superior glycemic control with less diabetes medication use and higher rates of diabetes remission.

Y,,JAMA,Endometriosis Typology and Ovarian Cancer Risk.,2024 Aug 13,10.1001/jama.2024.9210,39018030,"IMPORTANCE: Endometriosis has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer; however, the associations between endometriosis subtypes and ovarian cancer histotypes have not been well-described. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations of endometriosis subtypes with incidence of ovarian cancer, both overall and by histotype. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study using data from the Utah Population Database. The cohort was assembled by matching 78 893 women with endometriosis in a 1:5 ratio to women without endometriosis. EXPOSURES: Endometriosis cases were identified via electronic health records and categorized as superficial endometriosis, ovarian endometriomas, deep infiltrating endometriosis, or other. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), adjusted risk differences (aRDs) per 10 000 women, and 95% CIs for overall ovarian cancer, type I ovarian cancer, and type II ovarian cancer comparing women with each type of endometriosis with women without endometriosis. Models accounted for sociodemographic factors, reproductive history, and past gynecologic operations. RESULTS: In this Utah-based cohort, the mean (SD) age at first endometriosis diagnosis was 36 (10) years. There were 597 women with ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer risk was higher among women with endometriosis compared with women without endometriosis (aHR, 4.20 [95% CI, 3.59-4.91]; aRD, 9.90 [95% CI, 7.22-12.57]), and risk of type I ovarian cancer was especially high (aHR, 7.48 [95% CI, 5.80-9.65]; aRD, 7.53 [95% CI, 5.46-9.61]). Ovarian cancer risk was highest in women with deep infiltrating endometriosis and/or ovarian endometriomas for all ovarian cancers (aHR, 9.66 [95% CI, 7.77-12.00]; aRD, 26.71 [95% CI, 20.01-33.41]), type I ovarian cancer (aHR, 18.96 [95% CI, 13.78-26.08]; aRD, 19.57 [95% CI, 13.80-25.35]), and type II ovarian cancer (aHR, 3.72 [95% CI, 2.31-5.98]; aRD, 2.42 [95% CI, -0.01 to 4.85]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ovarian cancer risk was markedly increased among women with ovarian endometriomas and/or deep infiltrating endometriosis. This population may benefit from counseling regarding ovarian cancer risk and prevention and could be an important population for targeted screening and prevention studies.",【基于人群的回顾性队列研究】发现，卵巢子宫内膜异位囊肿和/或深部浸润型子宫内膜异位症显著增加卵巢癌（尤其I型）风险，提示此类患者需加强风险咨询与监测。,2024-08-13,2024.0

OBJECTIVE: To study the association of TIL abundance in breast cancer tissue with survival among patients with early-stage TNBC who were treated with locoregional therapy but no chemotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective pooled analysis of individual patient-level data from 13 participating centers in North America (Rochester, Minnesota; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), Europe (Paris, Lyon, and Villejuif, France; Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Milan, Padova, and Genova, Italy; Gothenburg, Sweden), and Asia (Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, Korea), including 1966 participants diagnosed with TNBC between 1979 and 2017 (with follow-up until September 27, 2021) who received treatment with surgery with or without radiotherapy but no adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. EXPOSURE: TIL abundance in breast tissue from resected primary tumors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival [iDFS]. Secondary outcomes were recurrence-free survival [RFS], survival free of distant recurrence [distant RFS, DRFS], and overall survival. Associations were assessed using a multivariable Cox model stratified by participating center. RESULTS: This study included 1966 patients with TNBC (median age, 56 years [IQR, 39-71]; 55% had stage I TNBC). The median TIL level was 15% (IQR, 5%-40%). Four-hundred seventeen (21%) had a TIL level of 50% or more (median age, 41 years [IQR, 36-63]), and 1300 (66%) had a TIL level of less than 30% (median age, 59 years [IQR, 41-72]). Five-year DRFS for stage I TNBC was 94% (95% CI, 91%-96%) for patients with a TIL level of 50% or more, compared with 78% (95% CI, 75%-80%) for those with a TIL level of less than 30%; 5-year overall survival was 95% (95% CI, 92%-97%) for patients with a TIL level of 50% or more, compared with 82% (95% CI, 79%-84%) for those with a TIL level of less than 30%. At a median follow-up of 18 years, and after adjusting for age, tumor size, nodal status, histological grade, and receipt of radiotherapy, each 10% higher TIL increment was associated independently with improved iDFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92 [0.89-0.94]), RFS (HR, 0.90 [0.87-0.92]), DRFS (HR, 0.87 [0.84-0.90]), and overall survival (0.88 [0.85-0.91]) (likelihood ratio test, P < 10e-6). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with early-stage TNBC who did not undergo adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, breast cancer tissue with a higher abundance of TIL levels was associated with significantly better survival. These results suggest that breast tissue TIL abundance is a prognostic factor for patients with early-stage TNBC.",【回顾性队列】研究发现，未经化疗的早期三阴性乳腺癌患者中，肿瘤浸润淋巴细胞水平越高，生存预后越好，提示TIL可作为重要预后标志物。,2024-04-02,2024.0
Y,,JAMA,Germline Genetic Testing After Cancer Diagnosis.,2023 Jul 3,10.1001/jama.2023.9526,37276540,"IMPORTANCE: Germline genetic testing is recommended by practice guidelines for patients diagnosed with cancer to enable genetically targeted treatment and identify relatives who may benefit from personalized cancer screening and prevention. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of germline genetic testing among patients diagnosed with cancer in California and Georgia between 2013 and 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study including patients aged 20 years or older who had been diagnosed with any type of cancer between January 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019, that was reported to statewide Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in California and Georgia. These patients were linked to genetic testing results from 4 laboratories that performed most germline testing for California and Georgia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was germline genetic testing within 2 years of a cancer diagnosis. Testing trends were analyzed with logistic regression modeling. The results of sequencing each gene, including variants associated with increased cancer risk (pathogenic results) and variants whose cancer risk association was unknown (uncertain results), were evaluated. The genes were categorized according to their primary cancer association, including breast or ovarian, gastrointestinal, and other, and whether practice guidelines recommended germline testing. RESULTS: Among 1 369 602 patients diagnosed with cancer between 2013 and 2019 in California and Georgia, 93 052 (6.8%) underwent germline testing through March 31, 2021. The proportion of patients tested varied by cancer type: male breast (50%), ovarian (38.6%), female breast (26%), multiple (7.5%), endometrial (6.4%), pancreatic (5.6%), colorectal (5.6%), prostate (1.1%), and lung (0.3%). In a logistic regression model, compared with the 31% (95% CI, 30%-31%) of non-Hispanic White patients with male breast cancer, female breast cancer, or ovarian cancer who underwent testing, patients of other races and ethnicities underwent testing less often: 22% (95% CI, 21%-22%) of Asian patients, 25% (95% CI, 24%-25%) of Black patients, and 23% (95% CI, 23%-23%) of Hispanic patients (P < .001 using the chi2 test). Of all pathogenic results, 67.5% to 94.9% of variants were identified in genes for which practice guidelines recommend testing and 68.3% to 83.8% of variants were identified in genes associated with the diagnosed cancer type. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients diagnosed with cancer in California and Georgia between 2013 and 2019, only 6.8% underwent germline genetic testing.

Pathogenic variants are associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Knowledge of prevalence, penetrance, and clinical characteristics of this disease have been limited by ascertainment biases based on known phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pathogenic variants in UBA1 and associated clinical manifestations in an unselected population using a genomic ascertainment approach. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational study evaluated UBA1 variants in exome data from 163 096 participants within the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative. Clinical phenotypes were determined from Geisinger electronic health record data from January 1, 1996, to January 1, 2022. EXPOSURES: Exome sequencing was performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome measures included prevalence of somatic UBA1 variation; presence of rheumatologic, hematologic, pulmonary, dermatologic, and other findings in individuals with somatic UBA1 variation on review of the electronic health record; review of laboratory data; bone marrow biopsy pathology analysis; and in vitro enzymatic assays. RESULTS: In 163 096 participants (mean age, 52.8 years; 94% White; 61% women), 11 individuals harbored likely somatic variants at known pathogenic UBA1 positions, with 11 of 11 (100%) having clinical manifestations consistent with VEXAS syndrome (9 male, 2 female). A total of 5 of 11 individuals (45%) did not meet criteria for rheumatologic and/or hematologic diagnoses previously associated with VEXAS syndrome; however, all individuals had anemia (hemoglobin: mean, 7.8 g/dL; median, 7.5 g/dL), which was mostly macrocytic (10/11 [91%]) with concomitant thrombocytopenia (10/11 [91%]). Among the 11 patients identified, there was a pathogenic variant in 1 male participant prior to onset of VEXAS-related signs or symptoms and 2 female participants had disease with heterozygous variants. A previously unreported UBA1 variant (c.1861A>T; p.Ser621Cys) was found in a symptomatic patient, with in vitro data supporting a catalytic defect and pathogenicity. Together, disease-causing UBA1 variants were found in 1 in 13 591 unrelated individuals (95% CI, 1:7775-1:23 758), 1 in 4269 men older than 50 years (95% CI, 1:2319-1:7859), and 1 in 26 238 women older than 50 years (95% CI, 1:7196-1:147 669).

OBJECTIVE: To study the associations between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and incidence of liver cancer and chronic liver disease mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort with 98 786 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative from 1993 to 1998 at 40 clinical centers in the US and were followed up to March 1, 2020. EXPOSURES: Sugar-sweetened beverage intake was assessed based on a food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline and defined as the sum of regular soft drinks and fruit drinks (not including fruit juice); artificially sweetened beverage intake was measured at 3-year follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were (1) liver cancer incidence, and (2) mortality due to chronic liver disease, defined as death from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver diseases, and chronic hepatitis. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for liver cancer incidence and for chronic liver disease mortality, adjusting for potential confounders including demographics and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 20.9 years, 207 women developed liver cancer and 148 died from chronic liver disease. At baseline, 6.8% of women consumed 1 or more sugar-sweetened beverage servings per day, and 13.1% consumed 1 or more artificially sweetened beverage servings per day at 3-year follow-up. Compared with intake of 3 or fewer servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per month, those who consumed 1 or more servings per day had a significantly higher risk of liver cancer (18.0 vs 10.3 per 100 000 person-years [P value for trend = .02]; adjusted HR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.16-2.96]; P = .01) and chronic liver disease mortality (17.7 vs 7.1 per 100 000 person-years [P value for trend <.001]; adjusted HR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.03-2.75]; P = .04). Compared with intake of 3 or fewer artificially sweetened beverages per month, individuals who consumed 1 or more artificially sweetened beverages per day did not have significantly increased incidence of liver cancer (11.8 vs 10.2 per 100 000 person-years [P value for trend = .70]; adjusted HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.70-1.94]; P = .55) or chronic liver disease mortality (7.1 vs 5.3 per 100 000 person-years [P value for trend = .32]; adjusted HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.49-1.84]; P = .88). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In postmenopausal women, compared with consuming 3 or fewer servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per month, those who consumed 1 or more sugar-sweetened beverages per day had a higher incidence of liver cancer and death from chronic liver disease.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of allogeneic CD19 CAR natural killer (NK)-cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm, prospective, first-in-human case series, we evaluated allogeneic CD19 CAR NK-cell therapy in adult patients (aged 18-65 years) with relapsed or refractory SLE at one site in China. Patients who had received at least two previous standard systemic therapies and continued to exhibit moderate-to-severe disease activity were eligible for inclusion. This study consisted of schedule escalation and dose escalation, with schedule escalation from 7 days and dose escalation commencing at 0.75 x 10(9) CAR NK cells on day 0. All patients received a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen with fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) per day) and cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2) per day) administered daily from days -5 to -3, followed by three CAR NK-cell infusions within a single treatment cycle at identical dose levels and inter-infusion intervals. Dose-limiting adverse events were monitored in patients for 28 days. The primary endpoints of this study were safety and tolerability, including the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06010472) and follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: 18 patients with relapsed or refractory SLE with moderate-to-severe disease activity were enrolled between Aug 21, 2023, and June 16, 2024. Of the 18 patients, 17 (94%) were female; the median age was 37.5 years (IQR 32.0-39.8), and the median disease duration was 10.5 years (IQR 4.5-14.8). Patients had received at least two standard systemic therapies, including biological agents (belimumab and telitacicept) in 14 (78%) of 18 patients, and plasmapheresis in one patient. Cytokine release syndrome was reported in one (6%) of 18 patients (grade 1). Neurotoxicity and other CAR NK-cell therapy-related severe adverse events were not observed, and there were no dose-limiting toxicities. Of the nine patients with more than 12 months' follow-up, six (67%) attained DORIS remission and lupus low disease activity state. INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that allogeneic CAR NK-cell therapy is a potent option for treatment of autoimmune diseases and indicates that such a therapy might address limitations of current autologous CAR T-cell therapy, including manufacturing scale and time, access, safety, and cost.

Y,,Lancet,Benchmarking progress in non-communicable diseases: a global analysis of cause-specific mortality from 2001 to 2019.,2025 Sep 20,S0140-6736(25)01388-1 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01388-1,40945529,"BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have received substantial policy attention globally and in most countries. Our aim was to quantify how much NCD mortality changed from 2010 to 2019 in different countries, especially compared with the preceding decade and with the best-performing country in each region, and the specific NCD causes of death that contributed to change. METHODS: We used data on NCD mortality by sex, age group, and underlying cause of death for 185 countries and territories from the 2021 WHO Global Health Estimates. Our primary outcome was the probability of dying from an NCD between birth and age 80 years in the absence of competing causes of death, and was calculated using age-specific death rates from NCDs and lifetable methods. We calculated change in the probability of death as the difference between values in the final and first year of each period (2001-10 and 2010-19). For 51 countries with high-quality mortality data and 12 countries with large populations within their region, we used the Horiuchi method of decomposition to calculate how much specific causes of death and 5-year age groups contributed towards: (1) increases or decreases in NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019; (2) improvements or deteriorations compared with the preceding decade (2001-10); and (3) differences from the country that had the largest reduction in each region. FINDINGS: From 2010 to 2019, the probability of dying from an NCD between birth and age 80 years decreased in 152 (82%) of 185 countries for females and in 147 (79%) countries for males; it increased in the remaining 33 (18%) countries for females and 38 (21%) countries for males. The countries where NCD mortality declined for females accounted for 72% of the world female population in 2019, and those where NCD mortality declined for males accounted for 73% of the world male population. NCD mortality declined in all high-income western countries, with Denmark experiencing the largest decline for both sexes and the USA experiencing the smallest decline. Among the largest countries in other regions, NCD mortality declined for both sexes in China, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, and Brazil, and increased for both sexes in India and Papua New Guinea. On average, females in countries in the central Asia, Middle East and north Africa region had the greatest reduction in NCD mortality followed by those in central and eastern Europe. For males, the largest reduction was among countries in central and eastern Europe, followed by those in central Asia, Middle East and north Africa. The smallest declines were those in the Pacific Island nations. Circulatory diseases were the greatest contributors to declines in NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019 in most countries, with some cancers (eg, stomach and colorectal cancers for both sexes, cervical and breast cancers for females, and lung and prostate cancers for males) also contributing towards lower NCD mortality in 2019 than in 2010 in many countries. Neuropsychiatric conditions and pancreatic and liver cancers contributed towards higher NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019 in most countries. In some countries, NCD mortality in working and older (>/=65 years) ages changed in the same direction leading to large overall declines or increases; in others, it changed in opposite directions, diminishing the magnitude of the overall change. In 75 (41%) of 185 countries for females and in 73 (39%) countries for males, the change in NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019 was an improvement (ie, larger decline, smaller increase, or reversal of an increase) compared with the change from 2001 to 2010. These countries accounted for 29% and 63% of the world female and male population, respectively, and included both sexes in Russia and Egypt, and males in China, India, and Brazil. Decadal changes saw a deterioration (ie, smaller decline, larger increase, or reversal of a decline) in the remaining 110 (59%) countries for females and 112 (61%) countries for males, including in both sexes in the USA, Nigeria, and Papua New Guinea, and females in China, India, and Brazil. Change from 2010 to 2019 saw deterioration in direction or size compared with the preceding decade for both sexes in most high-income western countries, most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and in east and southeast Asia, and for females in south Asia. There was a decadal improvement in the direction or size of change for many countries in central and eastern Europe (eg, Russia) and central Asia, and in parts of the Middle East and north Africa. Improvements or deteriorations in the direction or size of change in NCD mortality between the two decades resulted from multiple NCD causes of death. Among causes of death, the decline in mortality from circulatory diseases was smaller from 2010 to 2019 than from 2001 to 2010 in most countries, except in countries in central and eastern Europe and some countries in central Asia, where these declines were larger from 2010 to 2019 than from 2001 to 2010. Change in lung cancer saw a decadal improvement in many countries, especially for males, and many other cancers saw a mix of improvement and deterioration. INTERPRETATION: From 2010 to 2019, NCD mortality declined in four of every five countries in the world. These improvements were not as large as the preceding decade for most countries, driven by smaller declines in mortality from multiple NCDs.

Evaluating the consistency with clinical guidelines for treatment by use of individual high-resolution data from population-based cancer registries is a powerful tool to help interpretation of global inequalities in cancer survival. The VENUSCANCER project aims to assess the worldwide variation in patterns of care and time to initial treatment for women diagnosed with one of these three common cancers. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of anonymised individual records from population-based cancer registries (VENUSCANCER), 103 registries from 39 countries worldwide contributed high-resolution data for women diagnosed with cancer of the breast, cervix, or ovary for a single year of incidence during 2015-18. High-resolution data included cancer stage at diagnosis; staging procedures; tumour grade; biomarkers (ER, PR, and HER2); and the first course of each treatment modality (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine treatment, or anti-HER2 therapy) and related dates. We examined prognostic factors, key indicators of consistency with international clinical guidelines for treatment (ESMO, ASCO, and NCCN), and median time between diagnosis and treatment, by country or territory. We analysed the odds of women receiving treatment consistent with guidelines in high-income countries (HICs) and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), controlling for age and tumour subtype. FINDINGS: We received 275 792 anonymised individual records for women diagnosed with a cancer of the breast (214 111 [77.6%]), cervix (44 468 [16.1%], including in situ), or ovary (17 213 [6.2%]). In HICs, early-stage, node-negative cancers comprised over 40% of breast and cervical cancers, but less than 20% of ovarian cancers. By contrast, in LMICs, these proportions were generally below 20% for all three cancers, but higher in Cuba (30% for breast), and Russia (36% for cervix and 27% for ovary). Consistency with main international guidelines was highly variable, particularly for surgery and radiotherapy in early-stage breast cancer (from 13% in Georgia to 82% in France), chemotherapy in advanced cervical cancer (from 18% in Mongolia to 90% in Canada), and surgery plus chemotherapy in metastatic ovarian cancer (from 9% in Cuba to 53% in the USA). Some type of surgery was offered to 78% of women in HICs and 56% of women in LMICs, but initial treatment that is consistent with clinical guidelines for early-stage tumours was followed more uniformly for cervical and ovarian cancer than for breast cancer. Older women (aged 70-99 years) had lower odds of receiving initial treatment consistent with clinical guidelines than women aged 50-69 years in both HICs and LMICs. The median time between diagnosis and treatment for early-stage cancers was less than 1 month in several HICs, but up to 4 months for cervical cancer in Mongolia and ovarian cancer in Ecuador, and up to 1 year for breast cancer in Mongolia. INTERPRETATION: The VENUSCANCER project provides the first global picture of patterns of care for three of the most common cancers in women. These findings offer crucial real-world evidence to support the implementation and monitoring of global initiatives on cancer control such as WHO's Global Breast Cancer Initiative and Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative. Although guideline-consistent treatment has become more accessible for women diagnosed with early-stage tumours in LMICs, the proportion of these women diagnosed early remains far too low.

Y,,Lancet,Estimating the effect of maternal viral load on perinatal and postnatal HIV transmission: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025 Jul 26,S0140-6736(25)00765-2 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00765-2,40652949,"BACKGROUND: Although a growing body of evidence supports zero risk of sexual HIV transmission from a person with sustained virological suppression, known as U=U (undetectable equals untransmittable), data have been insufficient to determine whether this is also true for vertical HIV transmission. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify vertical transmission risk by maternal HIV viral load (mHVL) and to evaluate the applicability of U=U to perinatal and postnatal HIV transmission. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the WHO Global Health Library, and abstracts from the International AIDS Society Conference and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (2016-24) for studies published from Jan 1, 1989, to Dec 31, 2024, reporting the relationship between mHVL near birth (to estimate perinatal transmission risk by 6 weeks) or during breastfeeding (to estimate monthly postnatal transmission risk by mHVL within the past 6 months) and vertical transmission. We pooled risks of perinatal and postnatal transmission across prespecified mHVL categories. We also conducted comparative analyses to determine the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of transmission by mHVL using Poisson meta-regression. The protocol for this analysis is registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42019146768). FINDINGS: 147 studies were included in the analysis; 138 studies contributed to perinatal analyses and 13 studies contributed to postnatal analyses. Data on 82 723 mother-child pairs were included across all analyses. Pooled perinatal transmission risks were 0.2% (95% CI 0.2-0.3) with a mHVL of <50 copies per mL, 1.3% (1.0-1.7) with 50-999 copies per mL, and 5.1% (2.6-7.9) with >/=1000 copies per mL. aRRs of perinatal transmission were 6.3 (3.9-10.3) with a mHVL of 50-999 copies per mL and 22.5 (13.9-36.5) with >/=1000 copies per mL versus <50 copies per mL. In subgroup analyses, in five studies reporting on 4675 women receiving pre-conception antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a mHVL of <50 copies per mL near birth, there were zero (0%, 0.0-0.1) perinatal transmissions. Monthly postnatal transmission risks were 0.1% (0.0-0.4) with recent mHVL <50 copies per mL and 0.5% (0.1-1.8) with a mHVL of >/=50 copies per mL. INTERPRETATION: Perinatal transmission with a mHVL of <50 copies per mL is </=0.2% overall. Zero transmissions were observed among women receiving ART before pregnancy with a mHVL of <50 copies per mL near birth, supporting U=U in pregnancy and birth. Postnatal transmission was very low-but not zero-among women with a recent mHVL of <50 copies per mL. Current data, largely from studies lacking frequent mHVL monitoring or modern first-line ART regimens, are insufficient to assess U=U during breastfeeding.

In this study, we aimed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and evaluate the safety and tolerability of FT596 as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab. We also aimed to evaluate the antitumour activity and characterise the pharmacokinetics of FT596 as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab. METHODS: In this phase 1, first-in-human trial, we evaluated FT596 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma at nine sites in the USA. Patients who had received at least one previous systemic therapy and had no curative treatment options were eligible for inclusion. FT596 was administered after conditioning chemotherapy without rituximab (regimen A) or combined with rituximab (regimen B). The study consisted of a dose-escalation phase using a 3 + 3 design, with dose escalation commencing at 3 x 10(7) viable cells as a single dose on day 1 and done independently for individual regimens. A treatment cycle consisted of conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m(2)) and fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)) intravenously on days -5 to -3, followed by FT596 administered at various doses and schedules, without (regimen A) or with (regimen B) a single dose of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) intravenously on day -4. Supportive care was determined by the treating investigator. Patients were observed for dose-limiting adverse events for 28 days. Patients who tolerated therapy and derived clinical benefit could receive subsequent cycles of study treatment, with modification of conditioning chemotherapy dose if clinically indicated. The dose-expansion phase evaluated additional patients at selected doses and dosing schedules that had been found to be tolerable. The primary endpoints of the study were the incidence and nature of dose-limiting toxicities within each dose-escalation cohort to determine the maximum tolerated dose or maximum assessed dose to establish the RP2D and the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events, with severity determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria and Adverse Events version 5.0. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04245722. FINDINGS: Between March 19, 2020, and Jan 12, 2023, 86 patients with B-cell lymphoma received FT596 on regimen A (n=18) or regimen B (n=68). 22 (26%) of 86 patients were female and 72 (84%) of 86 patients were White. Patients had received a median of four previous lines of therapy (range 1-11) and 33 (38%) of 86 patients had received previous CAR T-cell therapy. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Cytokine release syndrome was reported in one (6%) of 18 patients (maximum grade 1) on regimen A and nine (13%) of 68 patients on regimen B (six with maximum grade 1 and three with grade 2). Neurotoxicity was not observed. INTERPRETATION: FT596 was well tolerated as monotherapy or with rituximab and induced deep and durable responses in patients with indolent and aggressive lymphomas and the RP2D was preliminarily identified to be 1.8 x 10(9) cells for three doses per cycle. This study supports that cell therapy using iPSC-derived, gene-modified NK cells is a potent platform for cancer treatment and suggests that such a platform might address limitations of currently available immune cell therapies, including manufacturing time, heterogeneity, access, and cost.

Y,,Lancet,The effects of government-led cash transfer programmes on behavioural and health determinants of mortality: a difference-in-differences study.,2025 Dec 6,S0140-6736(25)01437-0 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01437-0,41232551,"BACKGROUND: Poverty is strongly associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Government-led cash transfer programmes are crucial to poverty reduction strategies in many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although extensive research from individual programmes exists on the effects of cash transfers on beneficiaries, evidence of these programmes' population-wide health effects remains scarce. Previously, we showed that cash transfer programmes are associated with substantially reduced mortality rates among women and young children at the population level in LMICs. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying these reductions. METHODS: In this two-stage difference-in-differences study, we combined individual-level data from Demographic and Health Surveys in 37 LMICs with a comprehensive database of government-led cash transfer programmes between 2000 to 2019 to compare countries with cash transfer programmes and countries without these programmes before and after the introduction of them. We evaluated the effects of cash transfer programmes on 17 outcomes related to maternal health service use, fertility and reproductive decision making, caregiver health behaviours, and child health and nutrition. Outcomes were assessed across all respondents of the surveys but could not be differentiated between recipients and non-recipients for countries with cash-transfer programmes. FINDINGS: Among 37 countries included in the study, 20 introduced large-scale cash transfer programmes during the study period. We included data from 2 156 464 livebirths, and 954 202 children younger than 5 years. We identified statistically significant effects of cash transfer programmes on early antenatal care (5.0 percentage points, 95% CI 2.1 to 7.9; p(adjusted)=0.0019), facility deliveries (7.3 percentage points, 3.2 to 11.3; p(adjusted)=0.0014), delivery by a skilled birth attendant (7.9 percentage points, 3.2 to 12.6; p(adjusted)=0.0027), desired pregnancies (1.9 percentage points, 0.5 to 3.2; p(adjusted)=0.014), interdelivery intervals (2.5 months, 1.8 to 3.1; p(adjusted)=0.0017), unmet needs for contraception (-10.3 percentage points, -15.2 to -5.3; p(adjusted)=0.0006), exclusive breastfeeding (14.4 percentage points, 13.3 to 15.5; p(adjusted)=0.0004), minimum acceptable diets (7.5 percentage points, 5.5-9.5; p(adjusted)=0.0009), measles vaccinations (5.3 percentage points, 1.6 to 8.9; p(adjusted)=0.026), male twin livebirths (0.8 per 1000 male livebirths, 0.3 to 1.4; p(adjusted)=0.023), diarrhoeal illness (-6.4 percentage points, -11.7 to -1.1; p(adjusted)=0.038), and underweight nutritional status (-2.0 percentage points, -3.6 to -0.4; p(adjusted)=0.029). There were no statistically significant effects on age at first birth (1.6 months, -1.3 to 4.4; p(adjusted)=0.48), intended pregnancies (-0.2 percentage points, -2.8 to 2.3; p(adjusted)=0.86), small birth sizes (0.4 percentage points, -0.7 to 1.4; p(adjusted)=0.53), wasting (-2.1 percentage points, -5.0 to 0.9; p(adjusted)=0.17), and stunting (4.3 percentage points, -0.2 to 8.7; p(adjusted)=0.10). INTERPRETATION: As many countries consider the future of their cash transfer programmes, including whether to embrace approaches such as basic or guaranteed incomes, these findings provide new evidence on the numerous ways in which such programmes can improve population health.

We aimed to evaluate levels, trends, and observed-to-expected progress in prevalence and attributable burden from 2012 to 2021, with prevalence projections to 2050, in 204 countries and territories. METHODS: The prevalence and attributable burden of each target indicator were estimated by age group, sex, and year in 204 countries and territories from 2012 to 2021 in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, the most comprehensive assessment of causes of death, disability, and risk factors to date. Country-specific relative performance to date was evaluated with a Bayesian meta-regression model that compares prevalence to expected values based on Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of societal development status. Target progress was forecasted from 2021 up to 2050 by modelling past trends with meta-regression using a combination of key quantities and then extrapolating future projections of those quantities. FINDINGS: In 2021, a few countries had already met some of the GNTs: five for exclusive breastfeeding, four for stunting, 96 for child wasting, and three for child overweight, and none met the target for low birthweight or anaemia in females of reproductive age. Since 2012, the annualised rates of change (ARC) in the prevalence of child overweight increased in 201 countries and territories and ARC in the prevalence of anaemia in females of reproductive age decreased considerably in 26 countries. Between 2012 and 2021, SDI was strongly associated with indicator prevalence, apart from exclusive breastfeeding (|r-|=0.46-0.86). Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa had a decrease in the prevalence of multiple indicators that was more rapid than expected on the basis of SDI (the differences between observed and expected ARCs for child stunting and wasting were -0.5% and -1.3%, respectively). The ARC in the attributable burden of low birthweight, child stunting, and child wasting decreased faster than the ARC of the prevalence for each in most low-income and middle-income countries. In 2030, we project that 94 countries will meet one of the six targets, 21 countries will meet two targets, and 89 countries will not meet any targets. We project that seven countries will meet the target for exclusive breastfeeding, 28 for child stunting, and 101 for child wasting, and no countries will meet the targets for low birthweight, child overweight, and anaemia. In 2050, we project that seven additional countries will meet the target for exclusive breastfeeding, five for low birthweight, 96 for child stunting, nine for child wasting, and one for child overweight, and no countries are projected to meet the anaemia target. INTERPRETATION: Based on current levels and past trends, few GNTs will be met by 2030. Major reductions in attributable burden for exclusive breastfeeding and anthropometric indicators should be recognised as huge scientific and policy successes, but the comparative lack of progress in reducing the prevalence of each, along with stagnant anaemia in women of reproductive age and widespread increases in child overweight, suggests a tenuous status quo. Continued investment in preventive and treatment efforts for acute childhood illness is crucial to prevent backsliding. Parallel development of effective treatments, along with commitment to multisectoral, long-term policies to address the determinants and causes of suboptimal nutrition, are sorely needed to gain ground.

We assess the effects of further AIT among women recurrence-free after at least 5 years of endocrine therapy. METHODS: We conducted individual patient data meta-analyses of 12 randomised trials, including 22 031 women who had completed at least 5 years of tamoxifen, AIT, or tamoxifen then AIT, comparing subsequent AIT versus no further adjuvant therapy. Primary outcomes were recurrence of invasive breast cancer (local, distant, or new contralateral), breast cancer mortality, mortality from other causes, and all-cause mortality. Intention-to-treat analyses (irrespective of allocation adherence and stratified by age, nodal status, and trial, and censored at death from unrelated causes) yielded event rate ratios (RRs). FINDINGS: Allocation to AIT versus no further treatment reduced recurrence rates by 27% (RR 0.73 [95% CI 0.67-0.80], p<0.0001). This reduction was greater after previous tamoxifen alone than after some previous AIT, and greater in trials of 5 years of AIT versus no further AIT than in trials of 2-3 years of AIT versus no further AIT. After some previous AIT, allocation to 5 further years of AIT (with median 8.1 years [IQR 6.0-10.0] follow-up after trial treatments diverged) reduced both recurrence (RR 0.71 [0.61-0.81], p<0.0001; risk from year 5 to year 15 after diagnosis 11.6% vs 15.2%) and distant recurrence (RR 0.73 [0.61-0.88], p=0.0010; 6.6% vs 8.6%); breast cancer mortality was reduced non-significantly (RR 0.90 [0.70-1.15], p=0.40; 4.4% vs 5.0%). Tumour characteristics had no definite effects on the proportional recurrence reductions from year 5 to year 15, so the absolute recurrence reduction with 10 years vs 5 years AIT was greater for node-positive (risk 16.3% vs 20.1%) than for node-negative disease (9.1% vs 11.8%). Allocation to 5 further years of AIT increased 5-year bone fracture risk (RR 1.35 [1.13-1.61], p=0.0009; 4.6% vs 3.4%). Non-adherence to allocated treatment was widespread (39.0% further AIT vs 37.6% placebo in the placebo-controlled trials).

Y,,Lancet,Reductions in recurrence in women with early breast cancer entering clinical trials between 1990 and 2009: a pooled analysis of 155 746 women in 151 trials.,2024 Oct 12,S0140-6736(24)01745-8 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01745-8,39396348,"BACKGROUND: Distant recurrence in women with oestrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer persists at a constant rate for more than 20 years after diagnosis, with little equivalent data for oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. Using the database of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) we investigated rates of distant breast-cancer recurrence in oestrogen receptor-positive and oestrogen receptor-negative tumours and trends in outcomes over time. METHODS: In this pooled analysis of randomised controlled trial data, patients in the EBCTCG database of more than 650 000 women in trials of treatment for early-stage breast cancer were screened for eligibility. Women were eligible if they were enrolled between 1990 and 2009 and newly diagnosed with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and scheduled for at least 5 years of endocrine therapy, or oestrogen receptor-negative disease, and if they were younger than 75 years at diagnosis, had a tumour diameter of 50 mm or less, and fewer than ten positive axillary lymph nodes, and no evidence of distant metastases at entry. Trial of neoadjuvant therapy, or those in which adjuvant therapy was unclear, and women with oestrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-positive disease, or those for whom outcome or baseline data were missing were excluded. The primary outcome was time to first distant recurrence as defined by each trial, ignoring any locoregional recurrence or contralateral breast cancer. 10-year risks of distant recurrence by period of diagnosis were compared using Cox regression adjusted for patient and tumour characteristics, trial, and assigned treatment. FINDINGS: Of the 652 258 women with early breast cancer in the EBCTCG database on Jan 17, 2023, patient-level data were available from 151 randomised trials that included 155 746 women. Rates of distant tumour recurrence improved similarly in women with oestrogen receptor-positive and oestrogen receptor-negative tumours. 80.5% of the improvement for oestrogen receptor-positive disease and 89.8% of the improvement for eostrogen receptor-negative disease was explained by changes in patient and tumour characteristics and improved treatments, but remained significant (p<0.0001). More recently diagnosed patients were more likely to have node-negative disease. 10-year distant recurrence risks during 1990-99 versus 2000-09 were as follows: for node-negative disease, 10.1% versus 7.3% for oestrogen receptor-positive disease and 18.3% versus 11.9% for oestrogen receptor-negative disease; for disease with one to three positive nodes, 19.9% versus 14.7% for oestrogen receptor-positive disease and 31.9% versus 22.1% for oestrogen receptor-negative disease; and for disease with four to nine positive nodes, 39.6% versus 28.5% for oestrogen receptor-positive disease and 47.8% versus 36.5% for oestrogen receptor-negative disease. After adjustment for therapy, rates were reduced by 25% (oestrogen receptor-positive disease) and 19% (oestrogen receptor-negative disease) after 2000 versus the 1990s, with similar improvements observed in oestrogen receptor-positive disease beyond 5 years. INTERPRETATION: Most of the improvement in trial outcomes is explained by a greater proportion of women with lower-risk disease entering trials and improved adjuvant treatment. After adjustment, women diagnosed since 2000 have about a fifth lower rate of distant recurrence than the 1990s. Long-term risks of distant recurrence for oestrogen receptor-positive disease remain, but are about a tenth lower now than in our previous report.

Y,,Lancet,CD22-directed CAR T-cell therapy for large B-cell lymphomas progressing after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy: a dose-finding phase 1 study.,2024 Jul 27,S0140-6736(24)00746-3 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)00746-3,38996463,"BACKGROUND: Outcomes are poor for patients with large B-cell lymphoma who relapse after CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CAR19). CD22 is a nearly universally expressed B-cell surface antigen and the efficacy of a CD22-directed CAR T-cell therapy (CAR22) in large B-cell lymphoma is unknown, which was what we aimed to examine in this study. METHODS: In this single centre, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trial, we intravenously administered CAR22 at two dose levels (1 million and 3 million CAR22-positive T cells per kg of bodyweight) to adult patients (aged >/=18 years) who relapsed after CAR19 or had CD19-negative large B-cell lymphoma. The primary endpoints were manufacturing feasibility, safety measured by the incidence and severity of adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities, and identification of the maximum tolerated dose (ie, the recommended phase 2 dose). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04088890) and is active, but closed for enrolment. FINDINGS: From Oct 17, 2019, to Oct 19, 2022, a total of 41 patients were assessed for eligibility; however, one patient withdrew. 40 patients underwent leukapheresis and 38 (95%) had CAR T-cell products manufactured successfully. The median age was 65 years (range 25-84), 17 (45%) were women, 32 (84%) had elevated pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase, 11 (29%) had refractory disease to all previous therapies, and patients had received a median of four lines of previous therapy (range 3-8). Of the 38 patients treated, 37 (97%) had relapsed after previous CAR19. The identified maximum tolerated dose was 1 million CAR T cells per kg. Of 29 patients who received the maximum tolerated dose, no patients developed a dose-limiting toxicity or grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or immune effector cell-associated haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome. INTERPRETATION: This trial identifies CD22 as an immunotherapeutic target in large B-cell lymphoma and demonstrates the durable clinical activity of CAR22 in patients with disease progression after CAR19 therapy. Although these findings are promising, it is essential to recognise that this is a phase 1 dose-finding study. Further investigations are warranted to establish the long-term efficacy and to delineate the patient subgroups that will derive the most benefit from this therapeutic approach.

Y,,Lancet,Postoperative radiotherapy omission in selected patients with early breast cancer following preoperative breast MRI (PROSPECT): primary results of a prospective two-arm study.,2024 Jan 20,S0140-6736(23)02476-5 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(23)02476-5,38065194,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant breast radiotherapy as a standard component of breast-conserving treatment for early cancer can overtreat many women. Breast MRI is the most sensitive modality to assess local tumour burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether a combination of MRI and pathology findings can identify women with truly localised breast cancer who can safely avoid radiotherapy. METHODS: PROSPECT is a prospective, multicentre, two-arm, non-randomised trial of radiotherapy omission in patients selected using preoperative MRI and postoperative tumour pathology. It is being conducted at four academic hospitals in Australia. Women aged 50 years or older with cT1N0 non-triple-negative breast cancer were eligible. Those with apparently unifocal cancer had breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and, if pT1N0 or N1mi, had radiotherapy omitted (group 1). Standard treatment including excision of MRI-detected additional cancers was offered to the others (group 2). All were recommended systemic therapy. The primary outcome was ipsilateral invasive recurrence rate (IIRR) at 5 years in group 1. Primary analysis occurred after the 100th group 1 patient reached 5 years follow-up. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of the PROSPECT pathway were analysed. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12610000810011). FINDINGS: Between May 17, 2011, and May 6, 2019, 443 patients with breast cancer underwent MRI. Median age was 63.0 years. MRI detected 61 malignant occult lesions separate from the index cancer in 48 patients (11%). Of 201 group 1 patients who had BCS without radiotherapy, the IIRR at 5 years was 1.0% (upper 95% CI 5.4%). In group 1, one local recurrence occurred at 4.5 years and a second at 7.5 years. In group 2, nine patients had mastectomy (2% of total cohort), and the 5-year IIRR was 1.7% (upper 95% CI 6.1%). The only distant metastasis in the entire cohort was genetically distinct from the index cancer. The PROSPECT pathway increased QALYs by 0.019 (95% CI 0.008-0.029) and saved AU$1980 (95% CI 1396-2528) or  pound953 (672-1216) per patient. INTERPRETATION: PROSPECT suggests that women with unifocal breast cancer on MRI and favourable pathology can safely omit radiotherapy.

Y,,Lancet,"Activity limitations, use of assistive devices, and mortality and clinical events in 25 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries: an analysis of the PURE study.",2024 Aug 10,S0140-6736(24)01050-X [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01050-X,39068950,"BACKGROUND: The focus of most epidemiological studies has been mortality or clinical events, with less information on activity limitations related to basic daily functions and their consequences. Standardised data from multiple countries at different economic levels in different regions of the world on activity limitations and their associations with clinical outcomes are sparse. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of activity limitations and use of assistive devices and the association of limitations with adverse outcomes in 25 countries grouped by different economic levels. METHODS: In this analysis, we obtained data from individuals in 25 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study (175 660 participants). In the PURE study, individuals aged 35-70 years who intended to continue living in their current home for a further 4 years were invited to complete a questionnaire on activity limitations. Participant follow-up was planned once every 3 years either by telephone or in person. The activity limitation screen consisted of questions on self-reported difficulty with walking, grasping, bending, seeing close, seeing far, speaking, hearing, and use of assistive devices (gait, vision, and hearing aids). We estimated crude prevalence of self-reported activity limitations and use of assistive devices, and prevalence standardised by age and sex. We used logistic regression to additionally adjust prevalence for education and socioeconomic factors and to estimate the probability of activity limitations and assistive devices by age, sex, and country income. We used Cox frailty models to evaluate the association between each activity limitation with mortality and clinical events (cardiovascular disease, heart failure, pneumonia, falls, and cancer). The PURE study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03225586. FINDINGS: Between Jan 12, 2001, and May 6, 2019, 175 584 individuals completed at least one question on the activity limitation questionnaire (mean age 50.6 years [SD 9.8]; 103 625 [59%] women). Of the individuals who completed all questions, mean follow-up was 10.7 years (SD 4.4). The most common self-reported activity limitations were difficulty with bending (23 921 [13.6%] of 175 515 participants), seeing close (22 532 [13.4%] of 167 801 participants), and walking (22 805 [13.0%] of 175 554 participants); prevalence of limitations was higher with older age and among women. The prevalence of all limitations standardised by age and sex, with the exception of hearing, was highest in low-income countries and middle-income countries, and this remained consistent after adjustment for socioeconomic factors. The use of gait, visual, and hearing aids was lowest in low-income countries and middle-income countries, particularly among women. The prevalence of seeing close limitation was four times higher (6257 [16.5%] of 37 926 participants vs 717 [4.0%] of 18 039 participants) and the prevalence of seeing far limitation was five times higher (4003 [10.6%] of 37 923 participants vs 391 [2.2%] of 18 038 participants) in low-income countries than in high-income countries, but the prevalence of glasses use in low-income countries was half that in high-income countries. Walking limitation was most strongly associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.32 [95% CI 1.25-1.39]) and most consistently associated with other clinical events, with other notable associations observed between seeing far limitation and mortality, grasping limitation and cardiovascular disease, bending limitation and falls, and between speaking limitation and stroke. INTERPRETATION: The global prevalence of activity limitations is substantially higher in women than men and in low-income countries and middle-income countries compared with high-income countries, coupled with a much lower use of gait, visual, and hearing aids. Strategies are needed to prevent and mitigate activity limitations globally, with particular emphasis on low-income countries and women.

We aimed to estimate age-standardised mortality by racial-ethnic group, county, and cause of death and describe the intersection between racial-ethnic and place-based disparities in mortality in the USA, comparing patterns across health conditions. METHODS: We applied small-area estimation models to death certificate data from the US National Vital Statistics system and population data from the US National Center for Health Statistics to estimate mortality by age, sex, county, and racial-ethnic group annually from 2000 to 2019 for 19 broad causes of death. Race and ethnicity were categorised as non-Latino and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), non-Latino and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander (Asian), non-Latino and non-Hispanic Black (Black), Latino or Hispanic (Latino), and non-Latino and non-Hispanic White (White). We adjusted these mortality rates to correct for misreporting of race and ethnicity on death certificates and generated age-standardised results using direct standardisation to the 2010 US census population. FINDINGS: From 2000 to 2019, across 3110 US counties, racial-ethnic disparities in age-standardised mortality were noted for all causes of death considered. Mortality was substantially higher in the AIAN population (all-cause mortality 1028.2 [95% uncertainty interval 922.2-1142.3] per 100 000 population in 2019) and Black population (953.5 [947.5-958.8] per 100 000) than in the White population (802.5 [800.3-804.7] per 100 000), but substantially lower in the Asian population (442.3 [429.3-455.0] per 100 000) and Latino population (595.6 [583.7-606.8] per 100 000), and this pattern was found for most causes of death. However, there were exceptions to this pattern, and the exact order among racial-ethnic groups, magnitude of the disparity in both absolute and relative terms, and change over time in this magnitude varied considerably by cause of death. Similarly, substantial geographical variation in mortality was observed for all causes of death, both overall and within each racial-ethnic group. Racial-ethnic disparities observed at the national level reflect widespread disparities at the county level, although the magnitude of these disparities varied widely among counties. Certain patterns of disparity were nearly universal among counties; for example, in 2019, mortality was higher among the AIAN population than the White population in at least 95% of counties for skin and subcutaneous diseases (455 [97.8%] of 465 counties with unmasked estimates) and HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (458 [98.5%] counties), and mortality was higher among the Black population than the White population in nearly all counties for skin and subcutaneous diseases (1436 [96.6%] of 1486 counties), diabetes and kidney diseases (1473 [99.1%]), maternal and neonatal disorders (1486 [100.0%] counties), and HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (1486 [100.0%] counties). INTERPRETATION: Disparities in mortality among racial-ethnic groups are ubiquitous, occurring across locations in the USA and for a wide range of health conditions. There is an urgent need to address the shared structural factors driving these widespread disparities.

Cirrhosis develops after a long asymptomatic period of fibrosis progression, with the diagnosis frequently occurring late, when major complications or cancer develop. Few reliable tools exist for timely identification of individuals at risk of cirrhosis to allow for early intervention. We aimed to develop a novel score to identify individuals at risk for future liver-related outcomes. METHODS: We derived the LiverRisk score from an international prospective cohort of individuals from six countries without known liver disease from the general population, who underwent liver fibrosis assessment by transient elastography. The score included age, sex, and six standard laboratory variables. We created four groups: minimal risk, low risk, medium risk, and high risk according to selected cutoff values of the LiverRisk score (6, 10, and 15). The model's discriminatory accuracy and calibration were externally validated in two prospective cohorts from the general population. Moreover, we ascertained the prognostic value of the score in the prediction of liver-related outcomes in participants without known liver disease with median follow-up of 12 years (UK Biobank cohort). FINDINGS: We included 14 726 participants: 6357 (43.2%) in the derivation cohort, 4370 (29.7%) in the first external validation cohort, and 3999 (27.2%) in the second external validation cohort. The score accurately predicted liver stiffness in the development and external validation cohorts, and was superior to conventional serum biomarkers of fibrosis, as measured by area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC; 0.83 [95% CI [0.78-0.89]) versus the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4; 0.68 [0.61-0.75] at 10 kPa). The score was effective in identifying individuals at risk of liver-related mortality, liver-related hospitalisation, and liver cancer, thereby allowing stratification to different risk groups for liver-related outcomes. The hazard ratio for liver-related mortality in the high-risk group was 471 (95% CI 347-641) compared with the minimal risk group, and the overall AUC of the score in predicting 10-year liver-related mortality was 0.90 (0.88-0.91) versus 0.84 (0.82-0.86) for FIB-4. INTERPRETATION: The LiverRisk score, based on simple parameters, predicted liver fibrosis and future development of liver-related outcomes in the general population. The score might allow for stratification of individuals according to liver risk and thus guide preventive care.

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study done in oncology and primary care outpatient clinics at seven US health networks, a convenience sample of adults aged 50 years or older without signs or symptoms of cancer consented to MCED testing. We collected blood, analysed cfDNA, and returned results to participants' doctors. If a methylation signature indicative of cancer was detected, predicted cancer signal origin(s) informed diagnostic assessment. The primary outcome was time to, and extent of, diagnostic testing required to confirm the presence or absence of cancer.

In breast cancer, radiotherapy to regional lymph nodes aims to reduce risks of recurrence and death. Its effects have been studied in randomised trials, some before the 1980s and some after. We aimed to assess the effects of regional node radiotherapy in these two eras. METHODS: In this meta-analysis of individual patient data, we sought data from all randomised trials of regional lymph node radiotherapy versus no regional lymph node radiotherapy in women with early breast cancer (including one study that irradiated lymph nodes only if the cancer was right-sided). Trials were identified through the EBCTCG's regular systematic searches of databases including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts. Trials were eligible if they began before Jan 1, 2009. The only systematic difference between treatment groups was in regional node radiotherapy (to the internal mammary chain, supraclavicular fossa, or axilla, or any combinations of these). Primary outcomes were recurrence at any site, breast cancer mortality, non-breast-cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality. Data were supplied by trialists and standardised into a format suitable for analysis. A summary of the formatted data was returned to trialists for verification. Log-rank analyses yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals. FINDINGS: We found 17 eligible trials, 16 of which had available data (for 14 324 participants), and one of which (henceforth excluded), had unavailable data (for 165 participants). In the eight newer trials (12 167 patients), which started during 1989-2008, regional node radiotherapy significantly reduced recurrence (rate ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95; p=0.0008). The main effect was on distant recurrence as few regional node recurrences were reported. Radiotherapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.94; p=0.0010), with no significant effect on non-breast-cancer mortality (0.97, 0.84-1.11; p=0.63), leading to significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0.90, 0.84-0.96; p=0.0022). In an illustrative calculation, estimated absolute reductions in 15-year breast cancer mortality were 1.6% for women with no positive axillary nodes, 2.7% for those with one to three positive axillary nodes, and 4.5% for those with four or more positive axillary nodes. In the eight older trials (2157 patients), which started during 1961-78, regional node radiotherapy had little effect on breast cancer mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91-1.20; p=0.55), but significantly increased non-breast-cancer mortality (1.42, 1.18-1.71; p=0.00023), with risk mainly after year 20, and all-cause mortality (1.17, 1.04-1.31; p=0.0067). INTERPRETATION: Regional node radiotherapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in trials done after the 1980s, but not in older trials. These contrasting findings could reflect radiotherapy improvements since the 1980s.

Case series have suggested that allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) might improve the prognosis of advanced-stage CTCLs. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of allogeneic HSCT compared with non-HSCT therapy on the outcome of individuals with advanced-stage CTCLs. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, matched controlled trial, conducted at 30 hospitals, participants with advanced CTCLs were allocated treatment: if they had an available compatible related donor they were assigned to allogeneic HSCT, or if not they were allocated to non-allogeneic HSCT therapy. Key inclusion criteria were participants aged 18-70 years, with advanced stage mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome, and at least one poor prognostic criteria. Participants were excluded if they were not in complete or partial remission of the disease. Propensity score 1:1 matching with replacement (ie, that each participant treated with HSCT was matched to the participant with the closest propensity score treated with non-HSCT therapy, even if they had already been matched) was used to handle confounding factors, with the balance of covariate distribution between HSCT and non-HSCT groups assessed using standardised mean differences. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the matched intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02520908), and is currently active but not recruiting. FINDINGS: From June 1, 2016, to March 3, 2022, total of 99 participants were enrolled at 17 centres in France. Participants with a sibling or matched unrelated donor were assigned to allogeneic HSCT (HSCT group, n=55 [56%]) and participants without a donor were assigned to non-allogeneic HSCT treatment (non-HSCT group, n=44 [44%]). The median follow-up among survivors was 12.6 months (IQR 11.0-35.2). In the HSCT group, 51 participants (93%) were 1:1 matched to participants from the non-HSCT group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the HSCT group (9.0 months [95% CI 6.6-30.5]) than in the non-HSCT group (3.0 months [2.0-6.3]), with a hazard ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.21-0.69; p<0.0001). In the per-protocol population, 40 participants (78%) in the HSCT group had 101 serious events and 29 participants (67%) in the non-HSCT group had 70 serious adverse events. The most common serious adverse event other than graft-versus-host disease in both groups was infections, occurring in 30 participants (59%) in the HSCT group and in 19 participants (44%) in the non-HSCT group. INTERPRETATION: Allogeneic HSCT was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival in participants with advanced-stage CTCLs. These results indicate that allogeneic HSCT treatment should be made available to individuals with high-risk, advanced-stage mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome who achieve pre-transplant disease remission.

Y,,Lancet,Performance of cardiovascular disease risk prediction equations in more than 14 000 survivors of cancer in New Zealand primary care: a validation study.,2023 Feb 4,S0140-6736(22)02405-9 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02405-9,36702148,"BACKGROUND: People with cancer have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Risk prediction equations developed in New Zealand accurately predict 5-year cardiovascular disease risk in a general primary care population in the country. We assessed the performance of these equations for survivors of cancer in New Zealand. METHODS: For this validation study, patients aged 30-74 years from the PREDICT open cohort study, which was used to develop the New Zealand cardiovascular disease risk prediction equations, were included in the analysis if they had a primary diagnosis of invasive cancer at least 2 years before the date of the first cardiovascular disease risk assessment. The risk prediction equations are sex-specific and include the following predictors: age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation index, family history of cardiovascular disease, smoking status, history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio, and preventive pharmacotherapy (blood-pressure-lowering, lipid-lowering, and antithrombotic drugs). Calibration was assessed by comparing the mean predicted 5-year cardiovascular disease risk, estimated using the risk prediction equations, with the observed risk across deciles of risk, for men and women, and according to the three clinical 5-year cardiovascular disease risk groups in New Zealand guidelines (<5%, 5% to <15%, and >/=15%). Discrimination was assessed by Harrell's C statistic. FINDINGS: 14 263 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 61 years (SD 9) for men and 60 years (SD 8) for women, with a median follow-up of 5.8 years for men and 5.7 years for women. The observed cardiovascular disease risk was underpredicted by a maximum of 2.5% in male and 3.2% in female decile groups. When patients were grouped according to clinical risk groups, observed cardiovascular disease risk was underpredicted by less than 2% in the lower risk groups and overpredicted by 2.2% for men and 3.3% for women in the highest risk group. Harrell's C statistics were 0.67 (SE 0.01) for men and 0.73 (0.01) for women. INTERPRETATION: The New Zealand cardiovascular disease risk prediction equations reasonably predicted the observed 5-year cardiovascular disease risk in survivors of cancer in the country, in whom risk prediction was considered clinically appropriate. Prediction could be improved by adding cancer-specific variables and considering competing risks. Our findings suggest that the equations are reasonable clinical tools for use in survivors of cancer in New Zealand.

Y,,Lancet,Specific causes of excess late mortality and association with modifiable risk factors among survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.,2023 Apr 29,S0140-6736(22)02471-0 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02471-0,37030315,"BACKGROUND: 5-year survival after childhood cancer does not fully describe life-years lost due to childhood cancer because there are a large number of deaths occurring beyond 5-years (late mortality) related to cancer and cancer treatment. Specific causes of health-related (non-recurrence, non-external) late mortality and risk reduction through modifiable lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors are not well described. Through using a well-characterised cohort of 5-year survivors of the most common childhood cancers, we evaluated specific health-related causes of late mortality and excess deaths compared with the general US population and identified targets to reduce future risk. METHODS: In this multi-institutional, hospital-based, retrospective cohort study, late mortality (death >/=5 years from diagnosis) and specific causes of death were evaluated in 34 230 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed at an age younger than 21 years from 1970 to 1999 at 31 institutions in the USA and Canada; median follow-up from diagnosis was 29 years (range 5-48) in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Demographic, self-reported modifiable lifestyle (ie, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, and BMI) and cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia) associated with health-related mortality (which excludes death from primary cancer and external causes and includes death from late effects of cancer therapy) were evaluated. FINDINGS: 40-year cumulative all-cause mortality was 23.3% (95% CI 22.7-24.0), with 3061 (51.2%) of 5916 deaths from health-related causes. Survivors 40 years or more from diagnosis experienced 131 excess health-related deaths per 10 000 person-years (95% CI 111-163), including those due to the top three causes of health-related death in the general population: cancer (absolute excess risk per 10 000 person-years 54, 95% CI 41-68), heart disease (27, 18-38), and cerebrovascular disease (10, 5-17). Healthy lifestyle and absence of hypertension and diabetes were each associated with a 20-30% reduction in health-related mortality independent of other factors (all p values </=0.002). INTERPRETATION: Survivors of childhood cancer are at excess risk of late mortality even 40 years from diagnosis, due to many of the leading causes of death in the US population. Modifiable lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors associated with reduced risk for late mortality should be part of future interventions.

Y,,Lancet,Anthracycline-containing and taxane-containing chemotherapy for early-stage operable breast cancer: a patient-level meta-analysis of 100 000 women from 86 randomised trials.,2023 Apr 15,S0140-6736(23)00285-4 [pii] 10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00285-4,37061269,"BACKGROUND: Anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer substantially improves survival compared with no chemotherapy. However, concerns about short-term and long-term side-effects of anthracyclines have led to increased use of taxane chemotherapy without anthracycline, which could compromise efficacy. We aimed to better characterise the benefits and risks of including anthracycline, and the comparative benefits of different anthracycline-taxane regimens. METHODS: We did an individual patient-level meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing taxane regimens with versus without anthracycline, and updated our previous meta-analysis of anthracycline regimens with versus without taxane, as well as analysing 44 trials in six related comparisons. We searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts to identify trials assessing anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant trials were eligible if they began before Jan 1, 2012. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality. Log-rank analyses yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs) and CIs. FINDINGS: 28 trials of taxane regimens with or without anthracycline were identified, of which 23 were deemed eligible, and 15 provided data on 18 103 women. Across all 15 trials that provided individual data, recurrence rates were 14% lower on average (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.93; p=0.0004) with taxane regimens including anthracycline than those without. Non-breast cancer deaths were not increased but there was one additional acute myeloid leukaemia case per 700 women treated. The clearest reductions in recurrence were found when anthracycline was added concurrently to docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide versus the same dose of docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (10-year recurrence risk 12.3% vs 21.0%; risk difference 8.7%, 95% CI 4.5-12.9; RR 0.58, 0.47-0.73; p<0.0001). 10-year breast cancer mortality in this group was reduced by 4.2% (0.4-8.1; p=0.0034). No significant reduction in recurrence risk was found for sequential schedules of taxane plus anthracycline when compared with docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (RR 0.94, 0.83-1.06; p=0.30). For the analysis of anthracycline regimens with versus without taxane, 35 trials (n=52 976) provided individual patient data. Larger recurrence reductions were seen from adding taxane to anthracycline regimens when the cumulative dose of anthracycline was the same in each group (RR 0.87, 0.82-0.93; p<0.0001; n=11 167) than in trials with two-fold higher cumulative doses of non-taxane (mostly anthracycline) in the control group than in the taxane group (RR 0.96, 0.90-1.03; p=0.27; n=14 620). Direct comparisons between anthracycline and taxane regimens showed that a higher cumulative dose and more dose-intense schedules were more efficacious. The proportional reductions in recurrence for taxane plus anthracycline were similar in oestrogen receptor-positive and oestrogen receptor-negative disease, and did not differ by age, nodal status, or tumour size or grade. INTERPRETATION: Anthracycline plus taxane regimens are most efficacious at reducing breast cancer recurrence and death. Regimens with higher cumulative doses of anthracycline plus taxane provide the greatest benefits, challenging the current trend in clinical practice and guidelines towards non-anthracycline chemotherapy, particularly shorter regimens, such as four cycles of docetaxel-cyclophosphamide. By bringing together data from almost all relevant trials, this meta-analysis provides a reliable evidence base to inform individual treatment decisions, clinical guidelines, and the design of future clinical trials.

Y,,NEJM,Universal Base-Edited CAR7 T Cells for T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,2026 Jan 8,10.1056/NEJMoa2505478,41363805,"BACKGROUND: CD7 is an attractive target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Supportive results of first-in-human studies of base-edited anti-CD7 CAR (BE-CAR7) T cells with triple C-->T deamination-mediated knockouts of TCRalphabeta, CD52, and CD7 have been reported previously. METHODS: In a phase 1 study, we administered BE-CAR7 T cells to children (</=16 years of age) with relapsed or refractory T-cell ALL after they had undergone lymphodepletion with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and alemtuzumab. Adults with compassionate-use access arrangements were also eligible. Patients who had remission by day 28 after the BE-CAR7 T-cell infusion proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The primary outcome was safety. Secondary outcomes included duration of remission, disease-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: BE-CAR7 T cells were administered to 9 children, as well as to 2 adults who were treated under compassionate-use access arrangements. Lymphodepletion and BE-CAR7 infusions did not lead to unacceptable adverse events, and circulating CAR7 T cells were detected in all the patients. Complications included cytokine release syndrome of grades 1 through 4, transient rashes, multilineage cytopenia, and opportunistic infections. All the patients had complete morphologic remission with incomplete count recovery at day 28. Nine patients (82%) had deep remission (according to flow cytometry or polymerase-chain-reaction assay) that allowed them to proceed to stem-cell transplantation, and 2 patients with quantifiable minimal residual disease in bone marrow received palliative care. Transplantation eliminated remaining BE-CAR7 T cells and supported donor-derived, multilineage reconstitution. Viral reactivations were frequent, and 3 patients had clinically significant virus-related complications after transplantation. Overall, 7 of the 11 patients (64%) who received the investigational therapy were in ongoing remission at 3 to 36 months after transplantation, and leukemia with loss of CD7 expression was documented in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Universal BE-CAR7 T cells induced leukemic remission in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell ALL, thus allowing successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in most of the patients.

Y,,NEJM,Medical Imaging and Pediatric and Adolescent Hematologic Cancer Risk.,2025 Oct 2,10.1056/NEJMoa2502098,40961449,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the risk of radiation-induced hematologic cancer from medical imaging in children and adolescents might support informed decisions on the use of imaging. METHODS: We followed a retrospective cohort of 3,724,623 children born between 1996 and 2016 in six U.S. health care systems and Ontario, Canada, until the earliest of cancer or benign-tumor diagnosis, death, end of health care coverage, an age of 21 years, or December 31, 2017. Radiation doses to active bone marrow from medical imaging were quantified. Associations between hematologic cancers and cumulative radiation exposure (vs. no exposure), with a lag of 6 months, were estimated with the use of continuous-time hazards models. RESULTS: During 35,715,325 person-years of follow-up (mean, 10.1 years per person), 2961 hematologic cancers were diagnosed, primarily lymphoid cancers (2349 [79.3%]), myeloid cancers or acute leukemia (460 [15.5%]), and histiocytic- or dendritic-cell cancers (129 [4.4%]). The mean (+/-SD) exposure among children exposed to at least 1 mGy was 14.0+/-23.1 mGy overall (for comparison, 13.7 mGy was the exposure from one computed tomographic [CT] scan of the head) and 24.5+/-36.4 mGy among children with hematologic cancer. Cancer risk increased with cumulative dose, with a relative risk (vs. no exposure) of 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 1.78) for 1 to less than 5 mGy, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.43) for 15 to less than 20 mGy, and 3.59 (95% CI, 2.22 to 5.44) for 50 to less than 100 mGy. The cumulative radiation dose to bone marrow was associated with an increased risk of all hematologic cancers (excess relative risk per 100 mGy, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.70 to 3.51; P<0.001]; relative risk for 30 vs. 0 mGy, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.51 to 2.05]) and most tumor subtypes. The excess cumulative incidence of hematologic cancers by 21 years of age among children exposed to at least 30 mGy (mean, 57 mGy) was 25.6 per 10,000. We estimated that, in our cohort, 10.1% (95% CI, 5.8 to 14.2) of hematologic cancers may have been attributable to radiation exposure from medical imaging, with higher risks from the higher-dose medical-imaging tests such as CT. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests an association between exposure to radiation from medical imaging and a small but significantly increased risk of hematologic cancer among children and adolescents.

Y,,NEJM,Sevabertinib in Advanced HER2-Mutant Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,2025 Nov 6,10.1056/NEJMoa2511065,41104928,"BACKGROUND: HER2 gene mutations occur in 2 to 4% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sevabertinib is an oral, reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown anti-HER2 activity in preclinical models. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, multicenter, multicohort, phase 1-2 study to evaluate sevabertinib at a twice-daily dose of 20 mg in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC. Three cohorts were defined according to previous therapy: cohort D comprised previously treated patients who had not received HER2-targeted therapy; cohort E, patients who had previously received HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugates; and cohort F, patients who had not previously received treatment. The primary end point was an objective response, as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary end points were duration of response and progression-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients received sevabertinib (as of June 27, 2025, the data-cutoff date); the median duration of follow-up was 13.8 months in cohort D, 11.7 months in cohort E, and 9.9 months in cohort F. Among 81 patients in cohort D, an objective response was observed in 64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53 to 75); the median duration of response was 9.2 months (95% CI, 6.3 to 13.5), and the median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.9 to 12.3). Among 55 patients in cohort E, an objective response was observed in 38% (95% CI, 25 to 52); the median duration of response was 8.5 months, and the median progression-free survival was 5.5 months. Among 73 patients in cohort F, an objective response was observed in 71% (95% CI, 59 to 81), and the median duration of response was 11.0 months; data on progression-free survival were immature. Grade 3 or higher drug-related adverse events occurred in 31% of the patients. The most common adverse event was diarrhea (in 84 to 91%), with diarrhea of grade 3 or higher occurring in 5 to 23%. Treatment was discontinued by 3% of the patients owing to drug-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Sevabertinib showed antitumor activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event.

We designed an anti-CD19 enhanced (armored) CAR T-cell product (huCART19-IL18) that secretes interleukin-18 to enhance antitumor activity. METHODS: In this study, we assessed the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of huCART19-IL18 in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma after previous anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Using a 3-day manufacturing process, we administered huCART19-IL18-positive cells in doses ranging from 3x10(6) to 3x10(8). RESULTS: A total of 21 patients received huCART19-IL18. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 62% of the patients (47% with grade 1 or 2), and immune effector-cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 14% (all grade 1 or 2). No unexpected adverse events were observed. Robust CAR T-cell expansion was detected across all dose levels. At 3 months after infusion, a complete or partial response was seen in 81% of the patients (90% confidence interval [CI], 62 to 93) and a complete response in 52% (90% CI, 33 to 71). With a median follow-up of 17.5 months (range, 3 to 34), the median duration of response was 9.6 months (90% CI, 5.5 to not reached).

No effective therapy is known for patients with advanced HLRCC-associated papillary renal-cell carcinoma, and most patients die from progressive disease. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 2 study, we evaluated the efficacy of bevacizumab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) and erlotinib (150 mg once daily) in patients with advanced HLRCC-associated or sporadic papillary renal-cell carcinoma. The primary end point was overall response; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients with HLRCC-associated papillary renal-cell carcinoma and 40 patients with sporadic papillary renal-cell carcinoma were enrolled. A confirmed response occurred in 31 patients (72%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 57 to 83) with HLRCC-associated papillary renal-cell carcinoma; the median progression-free survival was 21.1 months (95% CI, 15.6 to 26.6), and the median overall survival was 44.6 months (95% CI, 32.7 to could not be estimated).

Whether this approach can be extended to all early-stage dMMR solid tumors, regardless of tumor site, is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study in which patients with stage I, II, or III dMMR solid tumors that were amenable to curative-intent surgery were treated with neoadjuvant dostarlimab, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blocking agent, for 6 months. The response to treatment was assessed in two cohorts: patients in cohort 1 had dMMR, locally advanced rectal cancer, and patients in cohort 2 had dMMR nonrectal solid tumors. Patients with a clinical complete response could elect to proceed with nonoperative management; those with residual disease were to undergo resection. In this analysis, the primary end point, assessed in cohort 1, was a sustained clinical complete response at 12 months. Recurrence-free survival and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included in the analysis. In cohort 1, all 49 patients who completed treatment had a clinical complete response and elected to proceed with nonoperative management. A total of 37 patients had a sustained clinical complete response at 12 months, a finding that met the criterion for efficacy. In cohort 2, a total of 35 of 54 patients who completed treatment had a clinical complete response, and 33 elected to proceed with nonoperative management. Among the 103 patients who completed treatment across both cohorts, 84 had a clinical complete response, and 82 did not undergo surgery. Among the 117 total patients, recurrence-free survival at 2 years was 92% (95% confidence interval, 86 to 99); the median follow-up for recurrence was 20.0 months (range, 0 to 60.8). The majority of patients (95%) had reversible, grade 1 or 2 adverse events (60%) or had no adverse events (35%). The option for curative resection was not compromised during or after treatment in any of the patients.

Y,,NEJM,Sustained Clinical Benefit of AAV Gene Therapy in Severe Hemophilia B.,2025 Jun 12,10.1056/NEJMoa2414783,40499172,"BACKGROUND: Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for hemophilia B. Data on safety and durability from 13 years of follow-up in a cohort of patients who had been successfully treated with scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco gene therapy are now available. METHODS: Ten men with severe hemophilia B received a single intravenous infusion of the scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco vector in one of three dose groups (low-dose: 2x10(11) vector genomes [vg] per kilogram of body weight [in two participants]; intermediate-dose: 6x10(11) vg per kilogram [in two]; or high-dose: 2x10(12) vg per kilogram [in six]). Efficacy outcomes included factor IX activity, the annualized bleeding rate, and factor IX concentrate use. Safety assessments included clinical events, liver function, and imaging. RESULTS: Participants were followed for a median of 13.0 years (range, 11.1 to 13.8). Factor IX activity remained stable across the dose cohorts, with mean factor IX levels of 1.7 IU per deciliter in the low-dose group, 2.3 IU per deciliter in the intermediate-dose group, and 4.8 IU per deciliter in the high-dose group. Seven of the 10 participants did not receive prophylaxis. The median annualized bleeding rate decreased from 14.0 episodes (interquartile range, 12.0 to 21.5) to 1.5 episodes (interquartile range, 0.7 to 2.2), which represented a reduction by a factor of 9.7. Use of factor IX concentrate decreased by a factor of 12.4 (interquartile range, 2.2 to 27.1). A total of 15 vector-related adverse events occurred, primarily transient elevations in aminotransferase levels. Factor IX inhibitor, thrombosis, or chronic liver injury did not develop in any participant. Two cancers were identified but were deemed by the investigators, together with an expert multidisciplinary team, as being unrelated to the vector. A liver biopsy that was conducted in 1 participant 10 years after the infusion revealed transcriptionally active transgene expression in hepatocytes without fibrosis or dysplasia. Levels of neutralizing antibodies to AAV8 remained high throughout follow-up, thus indicating potential barriers to readministration of the vector. CONCLUSIONS: A single administration of scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco gene therapy resulted in durable factor IX expression, sustained clinical benefit, and no late-onset safety concerns over a period of 13 years. These data support the long-term efficacy and safety of AAV gene therapy for severe hemophilia B.

Y,,NEJM,Efficacy of Zenocutuzumab in NRG1 Fusion-Positive Cancer.,2025 Feb 6,10.1056/NEJMoa2405008,39908431,"BACKGROUND: Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) fusions are recurrent oncogenic drivers found in multiple solid tumors. NRG1 binds to human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3), leading to heterodimerization with HER2 and activation of downstream growth and proliferation pathways. The efficacy and safety of zenocutuzumab, a bispecific antibody against HER2 and HER3, in patients with NRG1 fusion-positive solid tumors are unclear. METHODS: In this registrational, phase 2 clinical study, we assigned patients with advanced NRG1 fusion-positive cancer involving any tumor type to receive zenocutuzumab at a dose of 750 mg intravenously every 2 weeks. The primary end point was overall response (complete or partial response) according to investigator assessment. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 204 patients with 12 tumor types were enrolled and treated. Among 158 patients who had measurable disease and were enrolled at least 24 weeks before the data-cutoff date, a response occurred in 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23 to 37). The median duration of response was 11.1 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 12.9); 19% of responses were ongoing at the data-cutoff date. Responses were observed in multiple tumor types - including in 27 of 93 patients (29%; 95% CI, 20 to 39) with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 15 of 36 patients (42%; 95% CI, 25 to 59) with pancreatic cancer - and across multiple NRG1 fusion partners. The median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 9.1). Adverse events were primarily grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be related to zenocutuzumab were diarrhea (in 18% of the patients), fatigue (in 12%), and nausea (in 11%). Infusion-related reactions (composite term) were observed in 14% of the patients. One patient discontinued zenocutuzumab owing to a treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Zenocutuzumab showed efficacy in patients with advanced NRG1 fusion-positive cancer, notably NSCLC and pancreatic cancer, with mainly low-grade adverse events.

Y,,NEJM,Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis.,2025 Apr 24,10.1056/NEJMoa2413361,40267425,"BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-related condition associated with increased mortality among patients with cancer. CHIP mutations with high variant-allele frequencies can be detected in tumors, a phenomenon we term tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH). The frequency of TI-CH and its effect on tumor evolution are unclear. METHODS: We characterized CHIP and TI-CH in 421 patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the TRACERx study and in 49,351 patients from the MSK-IMPACT pan-cancer cohort. We studied the association of TI-CH with survival and disease recurrence and evaluated the functional effect of TET2-mutant CHIP on the biologic features of lung tumors. RESULTS: Among patients with NSCLC, 42% of those with CHIP had TI-CH. TI-CH independently predicted an increased risk of death or recurrence, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 2.63) as compared with the absence of CHIP and an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.02 to 2.56) as compared with CHIP in the absence of TI-CH. Among patients with solid tumors, 26% of those with CHIP had TI-CH. TI-CH conferred a risk of death from any cause that was 1.17 times (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.29) as high as the risk with CHIP in the absence of TI-CH. TET2 mutations were the strongest genetic predictor of TI-CH; such mutations enhanced monocyte migration to lung tumor cells, fueled a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment in mice, and resulted in the promotion of tumor organoid growth. CONCLUSIONS: TI-CH increased the risk of disease recurrence or death among patients with NSCLC and the risk of death from any cause among patients with solid tumors. TI-CH remodeled the tumor immune microenvironment and accelerated tumor organoid growth, findings that support a role for an aging-related hematologic clonal proliferation in cancer evolution.

Y,,NEJM,Assessment of a Polygenic Risk Score in Screening for Prostate Cancer.,2025 Apr 10,10.1056/NEJMoa2407934,40214032,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing. Screening with an assay of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has a high rate for false positive results. Genomewide association studies have identified common germline variants in persons with prostate cancer, which can be used to calculate a polygenic risk score associated with risk of prostate cancer. METHODS: We recruited persons 55 to 69 years of age from primary care centers in the United Kingdom. Using germline DNA extracted from saliva, we derived polygenic risk scores from 130 variants known to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Participants with a polygenic risk score in the 90th percentile or higher were invited to undergo prostate cancer screening with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transperineal biopsy, irrespective of PSA level. RESULTS: Among 40,292 persons invited to participate, 8953 (22.2%) expressed interest in participating and 6393 had their polygenic risk score calculated; 745 (11.7%) had a polygenic risk score in the 90th percentile or higher and were invited to undergo screening. Of these 745 participants, 468 (62.8%) underwent MRI and prostate biopsy; prostate cancer was detected in 187 participants (40.0%). The median age at diagnosis was 64 years (range, 57 to 73). Of the 187 participants with cancer, 103 (55.1%) had prostate cancer classified as intermediate or higher risk according to the 2024 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria, so treatment was indicated; cancer would not have been detected in 74 (71.8%) of these participants according to the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway currently used in the United Kingdom (high PSA level and positive MRI results). In addition, 40 of the participants with cancer (21.4%) had disease classified as unfavorable intermediate risk or as high or very high risk according to NCCN criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In a prostate cancer screening program involving participants in the top decile of risk as determined by a polygenic risk score, the percentage found to have clinically significant disease was higher than the percentage that would have been identified with the use of PSA or MRI.

Y,,NEJM,Next-Generation Multitarget Stool DNA Test for Colorectal Cancer Screening.,2024 Mar 14,10.1056/NEJMoa2310336,38477986,"BACKGROUND: A next-generation multitarget stool DNA test, including assessments of DNA molecular markers and hemoglobin level, was developed to improve the performance of colorectal cancer screening, primarily with regard to specificity. METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated a next-generation multitarget stool DNA test in asymptomatic adults 40 years of age or older who were undergoing screening colonoscopy. The primary outcomes were sensitivity of the test for colorectal cancer and specificity for advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer or advanced precancerous lesions). Advanced precancerous lesions included one or more adenomas or sessile serrated lesions measuring at least 1 cm in the longest dimension, lesions with villous histologic features, and high-grade dysplasia. Secondary objectives included the quantification of sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions and specificity for nonneoplastic findings or negative colonoscopy and comparison of sensitivities for colorectal cancer and advanced precancerous lesions between the multitarget stool DNA test and a commercially available fecal immunochemical test (FIT). RESULTS: Of 20,176 participants, 98 had colorectal cancer, 2144 had advanced precancerous lesions, 6973 had nonadvanced adenomas, and 10,961 had nonneoplastic findings or negative colonoscopy. With the next-generation test, sensitivity for colorectal cancer was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.1 to 97.7), and specificity for advanced neoplasia was 90.6% (95% CI, 90.1 to 91.0). Sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions was 43.4% (95% CI, 41.3 to 45.6), and specificity for nonneoplastic findings or negative colonoscopy was 92.7% (95% CI, 92.2 to 93.1). With the FIT, sensitivity was 67.3% (95% CI, 57.1 to 76.5) for colorectal cancer and 23.3% (95% CI, 21.5 to 25.2) for advanced precancerous lesions; specificity was 94.8% (95% CI, 94.4 to 95.1) for advanced neoplasia and 95.7% (95% CI, 95.3 to 96.1) for nonneoplastic findings or negative colonoscopy. As compared with FIT, the next-generation test had superior sensitivity for colorectal cancer (P<0.001) and for advanced precancerous lesions (P<0.001) but had lower specificity for advanced neoplasia (P<0.001).

Y,,NEJM,A Cell-free DNA Blood-Based Test for Colorectal Cancer Screening.,2024 Mar 14,10.1056/NEJMoa2304714,38477985,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer in adults in the United States. Early detection could prevent more than 90% of colorectal cancer-related deaths, yet more than one third of the screening-eligible population is not up to date with screening despite multiple available tests. A blood-based test has the potential to improve screening adherence, detect colorectal cancer earlier, and reduce colorectal cancer-related mortality. METHODS: We assessed the performance characteristics of a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) blood-based test in a population eligible for colorectal cancer screening. The coprimary outcomes were sensitivity for colorectal cancer and specificity for advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer or advanced precancerous lesions) relative to screening colonoscopy. The secondary outcome was sensitivity to detect advanced precancerous lesions. RESULTS: The clinical validation cohort included 10,258 persons, 7861 of whom met eligibility criteria and were evaluable. A total of 83.1% of the participants with colorectal cancer detected by colonoscopy had a positive cfDNA test and 16.9% had a negative test, which indicates a sensitivity of the cfDNA test for detection of colorectal cancer of 83.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.2 to 90.3). Sensitivity for stage I, II, or III colorectal cancer was 87.5% (95% CI, 75.3 to 94.1), and sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions was 13.2% (95% CI, 11.3 to 15.3). A total of 89.6% of the participants without any advanced colorectal neoplasia (colorectal cancer or advanced precancerous lesions) identified on colonoscopy had a negative cfDNA blood-based test, whereas 10.4% had a positive cfDNA blood-based test, which indicates a specificity for any advanced neoplasia of 89.6% (95% CI, 88.8 to 90.3). Specificity for negative colonoscopy (no colorectal cancer, advanced precancerous lesions, or nonadvanced precancerous lesions) was 89.9% (95% CI, 89.0 to 90.7).

Y,,NEJM,Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy in Locally Advanced Mismatch Repair-Deficient Colon Cancer.,2024 Jun 6,10.1056/NEJMoa2400634,38838311,"BACKGROUND: Mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors can be found in 10 to 15% of patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer. In these patients, the efficacy of chemotherapy is limited. The use of neoadjuvant immunotherapy has shown promising results, but data from studies of this approach are limited. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study in which patients with nonmetastatic, locally advanced, previously untreated dMMR colon cancer were treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The two primary end points were safety, defined by timely surgery (i.e., </=2-week delay of planned surgery owing to treatment-related toxic events), and 3-year disease-free survival. Secondary end points included pathological response and results of genomic analyses. RESULTS: Of 115 enrolled patients, 113 (98%; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 93 to 100) underwent timely surgery; 2 patients had surgery delayed by more than 2 weeks. Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 5 patients (4%), and none of the patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Among the 111 patients included in the efficacy analysis, a pathological response was observed in 109 (98%; 95% CI, 94 to 100), including 105 (95%) with a major pathological response (defined as </=10% residual viable tumor) and 75 (68%) with a pathological complete response (0% residual viable tumor). With a median follow-up of 26 months (range, 9 to 65), no patients have had recurrence of disease. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with locally advanced dMMR colon cancer, neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab had an acceptable safety profile and led to a pathological response in a high proportion of patients.

Y,,NEJM,Combination Targeted Therapy in Relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.,2024 Jun 20,10.1056/NEJMoa2401532,38899693,"BACKGROUND: The identification of oncogenic mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has led to the development of drugs that target essential survival pathways, but whether targeting multiple survival pathways may be curative in DLBCL is unknown. METHODS: We performed a single-center, phase 1b-2 study of a regimen of venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab, and lenalidomide (ViPOR) in relapsed or refractory DLBCL. In phase 1b, which included patients with DLBCL and indolent lymphomas, four dose levels of venetoclax were evaluated to identify the recommended phase 2 dose, with fixed doses of the other four drugs. A phase 2 expansion in patients with germinal-center B-cell (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL was performed. ViPOR was administered every 21 days for six cycles. RESULTS: In phase 1b of the study, involving 20 patients (10 with DLBCL), a single dose-limiting toxic effect of grade 3 intracranial hemorrhage occurred, a result that established venetoclax at a dose of 800 mg as the recommended phase 2 dose. Phase 2 included 40 patients with DLBCL. Toxic effects that were observed among all the patients included grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (in 24% of the cycles), thrombocytopenia (in 23%), anemia (in 7%), and febrile neutropenia (in 1%). Objective responses occurred in 54% of 48 evaluable patients with DLBCL, and complete responses occurred in 38%; complete responses were exclusively in patients with non-GCB DLBCL and high-grade B-cell lymphoma with rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 (or both). Circulating tumor DNA was undetectable in 33% of the patients at the end of ViPOR therapy. With a median follow-up of 40 months, 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21 to 47) and 36% (95% CI, 23 to 49), respectively.

Y,,NEJM,Risk of Second Tumors and T-Cell Lymphoma after CAR T-Cell Therapy.,2024 Jun 13,10.1056/NEJMoa2401361,38865660,"BACKGROUND: The risk of second tumors after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, especially the risk of T-cell neoplasms related to viral vector integration, is an emerging concern. METHODS: We reviewed our clinical experience with adoptive cellular CAR T-cell therapy at our institution since 2016 and ascertained the occurrence of second tumors. In one case of secondary T-cell lymphoma, a broad array of molecular, genetic, and cellular techniques were used to interrogate the tumor, the CAR T cells, and the normal hematopoietic cells in the patient. RESULTS: A total of 724 patients who had received T-cell therapies at our center were included in the study. A lethal T-cell lymphoma was identified in a patient who had received axicabtagene ciloleucel therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and both lymphomas were deeply profiled. Each lymphoma had molecularly distinct immunophenotypes and genomic profiles, but both were positive for Epstein-Barr virus and were associated with DNMT3A and TET2 mutant clonal hematopoiesis. No evidence of oncogenic retroviral integration was found with the use of multiple techniques.

Y,,NEJM,Repotrectinib in ROS1 Fusion-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,2024 Jan 11,10.1056/NEJMoa2302299,38197815,"BACKGROUND: The early-generation ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are approved for the treatment of ROS1 fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have antitumor activity, but resistance develops in tumors, and intracranial activity is suboptimal. Repotrectinib is a next-generation ROS1 TKI with preclinical activity against ROS1 fusion-positive cancers, including those with resistance mutations such as ROS1 G2032R. METHODS: In this registrational phase 1-2 trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of repotrectinib in patients with advanced solid tumors, including ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC. The primary efficacy end point in the phase 2 trial was confirmed objective response; efficacy analyses included patients from phase 1 and phase 2. Duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety were secondary end points in phase 2. RESULTS: On the basis of results from the phase 1 trial, the recommended phase 2 dose of repotrectinib was 160 mg daily for 14 days, followed by 160 mg twice daily. Response occurred in 56 of the 71 patients (79%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68 to 88) with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC who had not previously received a ROS1 TKI; the median duration of response was 34.1 months (95% CI, 25.6 to could not be estimated), and median progression-free survival was 35.7 months (95% CI, 27.4 to could not be estimated). Response occurred in 21 of the 56 patients (38%; 95% CI, 25 to 52) with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC who had previously received one ROS1 TKI and had never received chemotherapy; the median duration of response was 14.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to could not be estimated), and median progression-free survival was 9.0 months (95% CI, 6.8 to 19.6). Ten of the 17 patients (59%; 95% CI, 33 to 82) with the ROS1 G2032R mutation had a response.

Y,,NEJM,Prenatal cfDNA Sequencing and Incidental Detection of Maternal Cancer.,2024 Dec 5,10.1056/NEJMoa2401029,39774314,"BACKGROUND: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequence analysis to screen for fetal aneuploidy can incidentally detect maternal cancer. Additional data are needed to identify DNA-sequencing patterns and other biomarkers that can identify pregnant persons who are most likely to have cancer and to determine the best approach for follow-up. METHODS: In this ongoing study we performed cancer screening in pregnant or postpartum persons who did not perceive signs or symptoms of cancer but received unusual clinical cfDNA-sequencing results or results that were nonreportable (i.e., the fetal aneuploidy status could not be assessed) from one of 12 different commercial laboratories in North America. We used a uniform cancer-screening protocol including rapid whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), laboratory tests, and standardized cfDNA sequencing for research purposes with the use of a genomewide platform. The primary outcome was the presence of cancer in participants after the initial cancer-screening evaluation. Secondary analyses included test performance. RESULTS: Cancer was present in 52 of the 107 participants in the initial cohort (48.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of whole-body MRI in detecting occult cancer were 98.0% and 88.5%, respectively. Physical examination and laboratory tests were of limited use in identifying participants with cancer. Research sequencing showed that 49 participants had a combination of copy-number gains and losses across multiple (>/=3) chromosomes; cancer was present in 47 of the participants (95.9%) with this sequencing pattern. Sequencing patterns of cfDNA in which there were only chromosomal gains (multiple trisomies) or only chromosomal losses (one or more monosomies) were found in participants with nonmalignant conditions, such as fibroids. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 48.6% of participants who received unusual or nonreportable clinical cfDNA-sequencing results had an occult cancer.

Y,,NEJM,Nipocalimab in Early-Onset Severe Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn.,2024 Aug 8,10.1056/NEJMoa2314466,39115062,"BACKGROUND: In early-onset severe hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), transplacental transfer of maternal antierythrocyte IgG alloantibodies causes fetal anemia that leads to the use of high-risk intrauterine transfusions in order to avoid fetal hydrops and fetal death. Nipocalimab, an anti-neonatal Fc receptor blocker, inhibits transplacental IgG transfer and lowers maternal IgG levels. METHODS: In an international, open-label, single-group, phase 2 study, we assessed treatment with intravenous nipocalimab (30 or 45 mg per kilogram of body weight per week) administered from 14 to 35 weeks' gestation in participants with pregnancies at high risk for recurrent early-onset severe HDFN. The primary end point was live birth at 32 weeks' gestation or later without intrauterine transfusions as assessed against a historical benchmark (0%; clinically meaningful difference, 10%). RESULTS: Live birth at 32 weeks' gestation or later without intrauterine transfusions occurred in 7 of 13 pregnancies (54%; 95% confidence interval, 25 to 81) in the study. No cases of fetal hydrops occurred, and 6 participants (46%) did not receive any antenatal or neonatal transfusions. Six fetuses received an intrauterine transfusion: five fetuses at 24 weeks' gestation or later and one fetus before fetal loss at 22 weeks and 5 days' gestation. Live birth occurred in 12 pregnancies. The median gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks and 4 days. Of the 12 live-born infants, 1 received one exchange transfusion and one simple transfusion and 5 received only simple transfusions. Treatment-related decreases in the alloantibody titer and IgG level were observed in maternal samples and cord blood. No unusual maternal or pediatric infections were observed. Serious adverse events were consistent with HDFN, pregnancy, or prematurity. CONCLUSIONS: Nipocalimab treatment delayed or prevented fetal anemia or intrauterine transfusions, as compared with the historical benchmark, in pregnancies at high risk for early-onset severe HDFN.

Y,,NEJM,Sequential CD7 CAR T-Cell Therapy and Allogeneic HSCT without GVHD Prophylaxis.,2024 Apr 25,10.1056/NEJMoa2313812,38657244,"BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic cancers have a poor prognosis. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) has the potential for long-term tumor elimination. However, pre-HSCT myeloablation and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis agents have toxic effects and could eradicate residual CAR T cells and compromise antitumor effects. Whether the integration of CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic HSCT can preserve CAR T-cell function and improve tumor control is unclear. METHODS: We tested a novel ""all-in-one"" strategy consisting of sequential CD7 CAR T-cell therapy and haploidentical HSCT in 10 patients with relapsed or refractory CD7-positive leukemia or lymphoma. After CAR T-cell therapy led to complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery, patients received haploidentical HSCT without pharmacologic myeloablation or GVHD prophylaxis drugs. Toxic effects and efficacy were closely monitored. RESULTS: After CAR T-cell therapy, all 10 patients had complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery and grade 4 pancytopenia. After haploidentical HSCT, 1 patient died on day 13 of septic shock and encephalitis, 8 patients had full donor chimerism, and 1 patient had autologous hematopoiesis. Three patients had grade 2 HSCT-associated acute GVHD. The median follow-up was 15.1 months (range, 3.1 to 24.0) after CAR T-cell therapy. Six patients remained in minimal residual disease-negative complete remission, 2 had a relapse of CD7-negative leukemia, and 1 died of septic shock at 3.7 months. The estimated 1-year overall survival was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43 to 100), and the estimated 1-year disease-free survival was 54% (95% CI, 29 to 100).

Y,,NEJM,Atezolizumab for Advanced Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma.,2023 Sep 7,10.1056/NEJMoa2303383,37672694,"BACKGROUND: Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma with a poor prognosis and no established therapy. Recently, encouraging responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors have been reported. METHODS: We conducted an investigator-initiated, multicenter, single-group, phase 2 study of the anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) agent atezolizumab in adult and pediatric patients with advanced ASPS. Atezolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 1200 mg (in patients >/=18 years of age) or 15 mg per kilogram of body weight with a 1200-mg cap (in patients <18 years of age) once every 21 days. Study end points included objective response, duration of response, and progression-free survival according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, as well as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of multistep drug action. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were evaluated. An objective response was observed in 19 of 52 patients (37%), with 1 complete response and 18 partial responses. The median time to response was 3.6 months (range, 2.1 to 19.1), the median duration of response was 24.7 months (range, 4.1 to 55.8), and the median progression-free survival was 20.8 months. Seven patients took a treatment break after 2 years of treatment, and their responses were maintained through the data-cutoff date. No treatment-related grade 4 or 5 adverse events were recorded. Responses were noted despite variable baseline expression of programmed death 1 and PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab was effective at inducing sustained responses in approximately one third of patients with advanced ASPS.

Y,,NEJM,Actionable Genotypes and Their Association with Life Span in Iceland.,2023 Nov 9,10.1056/NEJMoa2300792,37937776,"BACKGROUND: In 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommended reporting actionable genotypes in 73 genes associated with diseases for which preventive or therapeutic measures are available. Evaluations of the association of actionable genotypes in these genes with life span are currently lacking. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of coding and splice variants in genes on the ACMG Secondary Findings, version 3.0 (ACMG SF v3.0), list in the genomes of 57,933 Icelanders. We assigned pathogenicity to all reviewed variants using reported evidence in the ClinVar database, the frequency of variants, and their associations with disease to create a manually curated set of actionable genotypes (variants). We assessed the relationship between these genotypes and life span and further examined the specific causes of death among carriers. RESULTS: Through manual curation of 4405 sequence variants in the ACMG SF v3.0 genes, we identified 235 actionable genotypes in 53 genes. Of the 57,933 participants, 2306 (4.0%) carried at least one actionable genotype. We found shorter median survival among persons carrying actionable genotypes than among noncarriers. Specifically, we found that carrying an actionable genotype in a cancer gene was associated with survival that was 3 years shorter than that among noncarriers, with causes of death among carriers attributed primarily to cancer-related conditions. Furthermore, we found evidence of association between carrying an actionable genotype in certain genes in the cardiovascular disease group and a reduced life span. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the ACMG SF v3.0 guidelines, we found that approximately 1 in 25 Icelanders carried an actionable genotype and that carrying such a genotype was associated with a reduced life span.

Y,,NEJM,Tarlatamab for Patients with Previously Treated Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,2023 Nov 30,10.1056/NEJMoa2307980,37861218,"BACKGROUND: Tarlatamab, a bispecific T-cell engager immunotherapy targeting delta-like ligand 3 and CD3, showed promising antitumor activity in a phase 1 trial in patients with previously treated small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: In this phase 2 trial, we evaluated the antitumor activity and safety of tarlatamab, administered intravenously every 2 weeks at a dose of 10 mg or 100 mg, in patients with previously treated small-cell lung cancer. The primary end point was objective response (complete or partial response), as assessed by blinded independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. RESULTS: Overall, 220 patients received tarlatamab; patients had previously received a median of two lines of treatment. Among patients evaluated for antitumor activity and survival, the median follow-up was 10.6 months in the 10-mg group and 10.3 months in the 100-mg group. An objective response occurred in 40% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 52) of the patients in the 10-mg group and in 32% (97.5% CI, 21 to 44) of those in the 100-mg group. Among patients with an objective response, the duration of response was at least 6 months in 59% (40 of 68 patients). Objective responses at the time of data cutoff were ongoing in 22 of 40 patients (55%) in the 10-mg group and in 16 of 28 patients (57%) in the 100-mg group. The median progression-free survival was 4.9 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 6.7) in the 10-mg group and 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.6 to 4.4) in the 100-mg group; the estimates of overall survival at 9 months were 68% and 66% of patients, respectively. The most common adverse events were cytokine-release syndrome (in 51% of the patients in the 10-mg group and in 61% of those in the 100-mg group), decreased appetite (in 29% and 44%, respectively), and pyrexia (in 35% and 33%). Cytokine-release syndrome occurred primarily during treatment cycle 1, and events in most of the patients were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 cytokine-release syndrome occurred less frequently in the 10-mg group (in 1% of the patients) than in the 100-mg group (in 6%). A low percentage of patients (3%) discontinued tarlatamab because of treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Tarlatamab, administered as a 10-mg dose every 2 weeks, showed antitumor activity with durable objective responses and promising survival outcomes in patients with previously treated small-cell lung cancer. No new safety signals were identified.

Y,,NEJM,Reappraisal of Idiopathic CD4 Lymphocytopenia at 30 Years.,2023 May 4,10.1056/NEJMoa2202348,37133586,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a clinical syndrome that is defined by CD4 lymphopenia of less than 300 cells per cubic millimeter in the absence of any primary or acquired cause of immunodeficiency. Some 30 years after its original identification, ICL has remained a disease of obscure cause, with limited evidence with respect to its prognosis or management, despite diagnostic and therapeutic innovations. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical, genetic, immunologic, and prognostic characteristics of 108 patients who were enrolled during an 11-year period. We performed whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing to identify genetic causes of lymphopenia. We also performed longitudinal linear mixed-model analyses of T-cell count trajectories and evaluated predictors of clinical events, the response to immunization against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), and mortality. RESULTS: After the exclusion of patients with genetic and acquired causes of CD4 lymphopenia, the study population included 91 patients with ICL during 374 person-years of follow-up. The median CD4+ T-cell count among the patients was 80 cells per cubic millimeter. The most prevalent opportunistic infections were diseases related to human papillomavirus (in 29%), cryptococcosis (in 24%), molluscum contagiosum (in 9%), and nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases (in 5%). A reduced CD4 count (<100 cells per cubic millimeter), as compared with a CD4 count of 101 to 300 cells, was associated with a higher risk of opportunistic infection (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8 to 10.7) and invasive cancer (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.3) and a lower risk of autoimmunity (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.9). The risk of death was similar to that in the age- and sex-adjusted general population, but the prevalence of cancer was higher. CONCLUSIONS: Among the study patients, ICL continued to be associated with increased susceptibility to viral, encapsulated fungal, and mycobacterial diseases, as well as with a reduced response to novel antigens and an increased risk of cancer.

Y,,NEJM,Interrupting Endocrine Therapy to Attempt Pregnancy after Breast Cancer.,2023 May 4,10.1056/NEJMoa2212856,37133584,"BACKGROUND: Prospective data on the risk of recurrence among women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer who temporarily discontinue endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a single-group trial in which we evaluated the temporary interruption of adjuvant endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy in young women with previous breast cancer. Eligible women were 42 years of age or younger; had had stage I, II, or III disease; had received adjuvant endocrine therapy for 18 to 30 months; and desired pregnancy. The primary end point was the number of breast cancer events (defined as local, regional, or distant recurrence of invasive breast cancer or new contralateral invasive breast cancer) during follow-up. The primary analysis was planned to be performed after 1600 patient-years of follow-up. The prespecified safety threshold was the occurrence of 46 breast cancer events during this period. Breast cancer outcomes in this treatment-interruption group were compared with those in an external control cohort consisting of women who would have met the entry criteria for the current trial. RESULTS: Among 516 women, the median age was 37 years, the median time from breast cancer diagnosis to enrollment was 29 months, and 93.4% had stage I or II disease. Among 497 women who were followed for pregnancy status, 368 (74.0%) had at least one pregnancy and 317 (63.8%) had at least one live birth. In total, 365 babies were born. At 1638 patient-years of follow-up (median follow-up, 41 months), 44 patients had a breast cancer event, a result that did not exceed the safety threshold. The 3-year incidence of breast cancer events was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 11.6) in the treatment-interruption group and 9.2% (95% CI, 7.6 to 10.8) in the control cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Among select women with previous hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, temporary interruption of endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy did not confer a greater short-term risk of breast cancer events, including distant recurrence, than that in the external control cohort. Further follow-up is critical to inform longer-term safety.

Y,,NEJM,"Helicobacter pylori, Homologous-Recombination Genes, and Gastric Cancer.",2023 Mar 30,10.1056/NEJMoa2211807,36988593,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection is a well-known risk factor for gastric cancer. However, the contribution of germline pathogenic variants in cancer-predisposing genes and their effect, when combined with H. pylori infection, on the risk of gastric cancer has not been widely evaluated. METHODS: We evaluated the association between germline pathogenic variants in 27 cancer-predisposing genes and the risk of gastric cancer in a sample of 10,426 patients with gastric cancer and 38,153 controls from BioBank Japan. We also assessed the combined effect of pathogenic variants and H. pylori infection status on the risk of gastric cancer and calculated the cumulative risk in 1433 patients with gastric cancer and 5997 controls from the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center (HERPACC). RESULTS: Germline pathogenic variants in nine genes (APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PALB2) were associated with the risk of gastric cancer. We found an interaction between H. pylori infection and pathogenic variants in homologous-recombination genes with respect to the risk of gastric cancer in the sample from HERPACC (relative excess risk due to the interaction, 16.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.22 to 29.81; P = 0.02). At 85 years of age, persons with H. pylori infection and a pathogenic variant had a higher cumulative risk of gastric cancer than noncarriers infected with H. pylori (45.5% [95% CI, 20.7 to 62.6] vs. 14.4% [95% CI, 12.2 to 16.6]). CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection modified the risk of gastric cancer associated with germline pathogenic variants in homologous-recombination genes.

Y,,NEJM,Cancer Screening after the Adoption of Paid-Sick-Leave Mandates.,2023 Mar 2,10.1056/NEJMsa2209197,36856618,"BACKGROUND: By the end of 2022, nearly 20 million workers in the United States have gained paid-sick-leave coverage from mandates that require employers to provide benefits to qualified workers, including paid time off for the use of preventive services. Although the lack of paid-sick-leave coverage may hinder access to preventive care, current evidence is insufficient to draw meaningful conclusions about its relationship to cancer screening. METHODS: We examined the association between paid-sick-leave mandates and screening for breast and colorectal cancers by comparing changes in 12- and 24-month rates of colorectal-cancer screening and mammography between workers residing in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that have been affected by paid-sick-leave mandates (exposed MSAs) and workers residing in unexposed MSAs. The comparisons were conducted with the use of administrative medical-claims data for approximately 2 million private-sector employees from 2012 through 2019. RESULTS: Paid-sick-leave mandates were present in 61 MSAs in our sample. Screening rates were similar in the exposed and unexposed MSAs before mandate adoption. In the adjusted analysis, cancer-screening rates were higher among workers residing in exposed MSAs than among those in unexposed MSAs by 1.31 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 2.34) for 12-month colorectal cancer screening, 1.56 percentage points (95% CI, 0.33 to 2.79) for 24-month colorectal cancer screening, 1.22 percentage points (95% CI, -0.20 to 2.64) for 12-month mammography, and 2.07 percentage points (95% CI, 0.15 to 3.99) for 24-month mammography. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of private-sector workers in the United States, cancer-screening rates were higher among those residing in MSAs exposed to paid-sick-leave mandates than among those residing in unexposed MSAs. Our results suggest that a lack of paid-sick-leave coverage presents a barrier to cancer screening.

Y,,NEJM,Familial Clonal Hematopoiesis in a Long Telomere Syndrome.,2023 Jun 29,10.1056/NEJMoa2300503,37140166,"BACKGROUND: Telomere shortening is a well-characterized cellular aging mechanism, and short telomere syndromes cause age-related disease. However, whether long telomere length is advantageous is poorly understood. METHODS: We examined the clinical and molecular features of aging and cancer in persons carrying heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the telomere-related gene POT1 and noncarrier relatives. RESULTS: A total of 17 POT1 mutation carriers and 21 noncarrier relatives were initially included in the study, and a validation cohort of 6 additional mutation carriers was subsequently recruited. A majority of the POT1 mutation carriers with telomere length evaluated (9 of 13) had long telomeres (>99th percentile). POT1 mutation carriers had a range of benign and malignant neoplasms involving epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuronal tissues in addition to B- and T-cell lymphoma and myeloid cancers. Five of 18 POT1 mutation carriers (28%) had T-cell clonality, and 8 of 12 (67%) had clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential. A predisposition to clonal hematopoiesis had an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, as well as penetrance that increased with age; somatic DNMT3A and JAK2 hotspot mutations were common. These and other somatic driver mutations probably arose in the first decades of life, and their lineages secondarily accumulated a higher mutation burden characterized by a clocklike signature. Successive generations showed genetic anticipation (i.e., an increasingly early onset of disease). In contrast to noncarrier relatives, who had the typical telomere shortening with age, POT1 mutation carriers maintained telomere length over the course of 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: POT1 mutations associated with long telomere length conferred a predisposition to a familial clonal hematopoiesis syndrome that was associated with a range of benign and malignant solid neoplasms. The risk of these phenotypes was mediated by extended cellular longevity and by the capacity to maintain telomeres over time.

Y,,NEJM,Pirtobrutinib after a Covalent BTK Inhibitor in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,2023 Jul 6,10.1056/NEJMoa2300696,37407001,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) have poor outcomes after the failure of covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor treatment, and new therapeutic options are needed. Pirtobrutinib, a highly selective, noncovalent (reversible) BTK inhibitor, was designed to reestablish BTK inhibition. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1-2 trial in which patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell cancers received pirtobrutinib. Here, we report efficacy results among patients with CLL or SLL who had previously received a BTK inhibitor as well as safety results among all the patients with CLL or SLL. The primary end point was an overall response (partial response or better) as assessed by independent review. Secondary end points included progression-free survival and safety. RESULTS: A total of 317 patients with CLL or SLL received pirtobrutinib, including 247 who had previously received a BTK inhibitor. Among these 247 patients, the median number of previous lines of therapy was 3 (range, 1 to 11), and 100 patients (40.5%) had also received a B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor such as venetoclax. The percentage of patients with an overall response to pirtobrutinib was 73.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.3 to 78.7), and the percentage was 82.2% (95% CI, 76.8 to 86.7) when partial response with lymphocytosis was included. The median progression-free survival was 19.6 months (95% CI, 16.9 to 22.1). Among all 317 patients with CLL or SLL who received pirtobrutinib, the most common adverse events were infections (in 71.0%), bleeding (in 42.6%), and neutropenia (in 32.5%). At a median duration of treatment of 16.5 months (range, 0.2 to 39.9), some adverse events that are typically associated with BTK inhibitors occurred relatively infrequently, including hypertension (in 14.2% of patients), atrial fibrillation or flutter (in 3.8%), and major hemorrhage (in 2.2%). Only 9 of 317 patients (2.8%) discontinued pirtobrutinib owing to a treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, pirtobrutinib showed efficacy in patients with heavily pretreated CLL or SLL who had received a covalent BTK inhibitor.

Treatment with the use of surgery, radiation, or both is often associated with substantial morbidity related to vision loss, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and memory loss. Genotyping has shown that more than 90% of papillary craniopharyngiomas carry BRAF V600E mutations, but data are lacking with regard to the safety and efficacy of BRAF-MEK inhibition in patients with papillary craniopharyngiomas who have not undergone previous radiation therapy. METHODS: Eligible patients who had papillary craniopharyngiomas that tested positive for BRAF mutations, had not undergone radiation therapy previously, and had measurable disease received the BRAF-MEK inhibitor combination vemurafenib-cobimetinib in 28-day cycles. The primary end point of this single-group, phase 2 study was objective response at 4 months as determined with the use of centrally determined volumetric data. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients in the study, 15 (94%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 70 to 100) had a durable objective partial response or better to therapy. The median reduction in the volume of the tumor was 91% (range, 68 to 99). The median follow-up was 22 months (95% CI, 19 to 30) and the median number of treatment cycles was 8. Progression-free survival was 87% (95% CI, 57 to 98) at 12 months and 58% (95% CI, 10 to 89) at 24 months. Three patients had disease progression during follow-up after therapy had been discontinued; none have died.

Preclinical studies suggest that combining a KRAS G12C inhibitor with an epidermal growth factor receptor antibody could be an effective clinical strategy. METHODS: In this phase 1-2, open-label, nonrandomized clinical trial, we assigned heavily pretreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with mutant KRAS G12C to receive adagrasib monotherapy (600 mg orally twice daily) or adagrasib (at the same dose) in combination with intravenous cetuximab once a week (with an initial loading dose of 400 mg per square meter of body-surface area, followed by a dose of 250 mg per square meter) or every 2 weeks (with a dose of 500 mg per square meter). The primary end points were objective response (complete or partial response) and safety. RESULTS: As of June 16, 2022, a total of 44 patients had received adagrasib, and 32 had received combination therapy with adagrasib and cetuximab, with a median follow-up of 20.1 months and 17.5 months, respectively. In the monotherapy group (43 evaluable patients), a response was reported in 19% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 8 to 33). The median response duration was 4.3 months (95% CI, 2.3 to 8.3), and the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 8.3). In the combination-therapy group (28 evaluable patients), the response was 46% (95% CI, 28 to 66). The median response duration was 7.6 months (95% CI, 5.7 to not estimable), and the median progression-free survival was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 8.1).

Y,,NEJM,Sotorasib in KRAS p.G12C-Mutated Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.,2023 Jan 5,10.1056/NEJMoa2208470,36546651,"BACKGROUND: KRAS p.G12C mutation occurs in approximately 1 to 2% of pancreatic cancers. The safety and efficacy of sotorasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, in previously treated patients with KRAS p.G12C-mutated pancreatic cancer are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a single-group, phase 1-2 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of sotorasib treatment in patients with KRAS p.G12C-mutated pancreatic cancer who had received at least one previous systemic therapy. The primary objective of phase 1 was to assess safety and to identify the recommended dose for phase 2. In phase 2, patients received sotorasib at a dose of 960 mg orally once daily. The primary end point for phase 2 was a centrally confirmed objective response (defined as a complete or partial response). Efficacy end points were assessed in the pooled population from both phases and included objective response, duration of response, time to objective response, disease control (defined as an objective response or stable disease), progression-free survival, and overall survival. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: The pooled population from phases 1 and 2 consisted of 38 patients, all of whom had metastatic disease at enrollment and had previously received chemotherapy. At baseline, patients had received a median of 2 lines (range, 1 to 8) of therapy previously. All 38 patients received sotorasib in the trial. A total of 8 patients had a centrally confirmed objective response (21%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10 to 37). The median progression-free survival was 4.0 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.6), and the median overall survival was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 9.1). Treatment-related adverse events of any grade were reported in 16 patients (42%); 6 patients (16%) had grade 3 adverse events.

Y,,NEJM,Futibatinib for FGFR2-Rearranged Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.,2023 Jan 19,10.1056/NEJMoa2206834,36652354,"BACKGROUND: Alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) have emerged as promising drug targets for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer with a poor prognosis. Futibatinib, a next-generation, covalently binding FGFR1-4 inhibitor, has been shown to have both antitumor activity in patients with FGFR-altered tumors and strong preclinical activity against acquired resistance mutations associated with ATP-competitive FGFR inhibitors. METHODS: In this multinational, open-label, single-group, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients with unresectable or metastatic FGFR2 fusion-positive or FGFR2 rearrangement-positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and disease progression after one or more previous lines of systemic therapy (excluding FGFR inhibitors). The patients received oral futibatinib at a dose of 20 mg once daily in a continuous regimen. The primary end point was objective response (partial or complete response), as assessed by independent central review. Secondary end points included the response duration, progression-free and overall survival, safety, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: Between April 16, 2018, and November 29, 2019, a total of 103 patients were enrolled and received futibatinib. A total of 43 of 103 patients (42%; 95% confidence interval, 32 to 52) had a response, and the median duration of response was 9.7 months. Responses were consistent across patient subgroups, including patients with heavily pretreated disease, older adults, and patients who had co-occurring TP53 mutations. At a median follow-up of 17.1 months, the median progression-free survival was 9.0 months and overall survival was 21.7 months. Common treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were hyperphosphatemia (in 30% of the patients), an increased aspartate aminotransferase level (in 7%), stomatitis (in 6%), and fatigue (in 6%). Treatment-related adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of futibatinib in 2% of the patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Quality of life was maintained throughout treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In previously treated patients with FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement-positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the use of futibatinib, a covalent FGFR inhibitor, led to measurable clinical benefit.

Y,,NEJM,Anti-Epstein-Barr Virus BNLF2b for Mass Screening for Nasopharyngeal Cancer.,2023 Aug 31,10.1056/NEJMoa2301496,37646678,"BACKGROUND: Population screening of asymptomatic persons with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA or antibodies has improved the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and survival among affected persons. However, the positive predictive value of current screening strategies is unsatisfactory even in areas where nasopharyngeal carcinoma is endemic. METHODS: We designed a peptide library representing highly ranked B-cell epitopes of EBV coding sequences to identify novel serologic biomarkers for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. After a retrospective case-control study, the performance of the novel biomarker anti-BNLF2b total antibody (P85-Ab) was validated through a large-scale prospective screening program and compared with that of the standard two-antibody-based screening method (EBV nuclear antigen 1 [EBNA1]-IgA and EBV-specific viral capsid antigen [VCA]-IgA). RESULTS: P85-Ab was the most promising biomarker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma screening, with high sensitivity (94.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 86.4 to 97.8) and specificity (99.6%; 95% CI, 97.8 to 99.9) in the retrospective case-control study. Among the 24,852 eligible participants in the prospective cohort, 47 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (38 at an early stage) were identified. P85-Ab showed higher sensitivity than the two-antibody method (97.9% vs. 72.3%; ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6]), higher specificity (98.3% vs. 97.0%; ratio, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.02]), and a higher positive predictive value (10.0% vs. 4.3%; ratio, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.8 to 2.8]). The combination of P85-Ab and the two-antibody method markedly increased the positive predictive value to 44.6% (95% CI, 33.8 to 55.9), with sensitivity of 70.2% (95% CI, 56.0 to 81.4). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that P85-Ab is a promising novel biomarker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma screening, with higher sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value than the standard two-antibody method.

Y,,NEJM,Health Consequences of Thymus Removal in Adults.,2023 Aug 3,10.1056/NEJMoa2302892,37530823,"BACKGROUND: The function of the thymus in human adults is unclear, and routine removal of the thymus is performed in a variety of surgical procedures. We hypothesized that the adult thymus is needed to sustain immune competence and overall health. METHODS: We evaluated the risk of death, cancer, and autoimmune disease among adult patients who had undergone thymectomy as compared with demographically matched controls who had undergone similar cardiothoracic surgery without thymectomy. T-cell production and plasma cytokine levels were also compared in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: After exclusions, 1420 patients who had undergone thymectomy and 6021 controls were included in the study; 1146 of the patients who had undergone thymectomy had a matched control and were included in the primary cohort. At 5 years after surgery, all-cause mortality was higher in the thymectomy group than in the control group (8.1% vs. 2.8%; relative risk, 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 4.8), as was the risk of cancer (7.4% vs. 3.7%; relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.2). Although the risk of autoimmune disease did not differ substantially between the groups in the overall primary cohort (relative risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4), a difference was found when patients with preoperative infection, cancer, or autoimmune disease were excluded from the analysis (12.3% vs. 7.9%; relative risk, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.2). In an analysis involving all patients with more than 5 years of follow-up (with or without a matched control), all-cause mortality was higher in the thymectomy group than in the general U.S. population (9.0% vs. 5.2%), as was mortality due to cancer (2.3% vs. 1.5%). In the subgroup of patients in whom T-cell production and plasma cytokine levels were measured (22 in the thymectomy group and 19 in the control group; mean follow-up, 14.2 postoperative years), those who had undergone thymectomy had less new production of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes than controls (mean CD4+ signal joint T-cell receptor excision circle [sjTREC] count, 1451 vs. 526 per microgram of DNA [P = 0.009]; mean CD8+ sjTREC count, 1466 vs. 447 per microgram of DNA [P<0.001]) and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, all-cause mortality and the risk of cancer were higher among patients who had undergone thymectomy than among controls. Thymectomy also appeared be associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disease when patients with preoperative infection, cancer, or autoimmune disease were excluded from the analysis.

Y,,NEJM,Single-Agent Divarasib (GDC-6036) in Solid Tumors with a KRAS G12C Mutation.,2023 Aug 24,10.1056/NEJMoa2303810,37611121,"BACKGROUND: Divarasib (GDC-6036) is a covalent KRAS G12C inhibitor that was designed to have high potency and selectivity. METHODS: In a phase 1 study, we evaluated divarasib administered orally once daily (at doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg) in patients who had advanced or metastatic solid tumors that harbor a KRAS G12C mutation. The primary objective was an assessment of safety; pharmacokinetics, investigator-evaluated antitumor activity, and biomarkers of response and resistance were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 137 patients (60 with non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC], 55 with colorectal cancer, and 22 with other solid tumors) received divarasib. No dose-limiting toxic effects or treatment-related deaths were reported. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 127 patients (93%); grade 3 events occurred in 15 patients (11%) and a grade 4 event in 1 patient (1%). Treatment-related adverse events resulted in a dose reduction in 19 patients (14%) and discontinuation of treatment in 4 patients (3%). Among patients with NSCLC, a confirmed response was observed in 53.4% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.9 to 66.7), and the median progression-free survival was 13.1 months (95% CI, 8.8 to could not be estimated). Among patients with colorectal cancer, a confirmed response was observed in 29.1% of patients (95% CI, 17.6 to 42.9), and the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 8.2). Responses were also observed in patients with other solid tumors. Serial assessment of circulating tumor DNA showed declines in KRAS G12C variant allele frequency associated with response and identified genomic alterations that may confer resistance to divarasib. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with divarasib resulted in durable clinical responses across KRAS G12C-positive tumors, with mostly low-grade adverse events.

Y,,NEJM,Omitting Radiotherapy after Breast-Conserving Surgery in Luminal A Breast Cancer.,2023 Aug 17,10.1056/NEJMoa2302344,37585627,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant radiotherapy is prescribed after breast-conserving surgery to reduce the risk of local recurrence. However, radiotherapy is inconvenient, costly, and associated with both short-term and long-term side effects. Clinicopathologic factors alone are of limited use in the identification of women at low risk for local recurrence in whom radiotherapy can be omitted. Molecularly defined intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer can provide additional prognostic information. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study involving women who were at least 55 years of age, had undergone breast-conserving surgery for T1N0 (tumor size <2 cm and node negative), grade 1 or 2, luminal A-subtype breast cancer (defined as estrogen receptor positivity of >/=1%, progesterone receptor positivity of >20%, negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and Ki67 index of </=13.25%), and had received adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients who met the clinical eligibility criteria were registered, and Ki67 immunohistochemical analysis was performed centrally. Patients with a Ki67 index of 13.25% or less were enrolled and did not receive radiotherapy. The primary outcome was local recurrence in the ipsilateral breast. In consultation with radiation oncologists and patients with breast cancer, we determined that if the upper boundary of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the cumulative incidence at 5 years was less than 5%, this would represent an acceptable risk of local recurrence at 5 years. RESULTS: Of 740 registered patients, 500 eligible patients were enrolled. At 5 years after enrollment, recurrence was reported in 2.3% of the patients (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.1), a result that met the prespecified boundary. Breast cancer occurred in the contralateral breast in 1.9% of the patients (90% CI, 1.1 to 3.2), and recurrence of any type was observed in 2.7% (90% CI, 1.6 to 4.1). CONCLUSIONS: Among women who were at least 55 years of age and had T1N0, grade 1 or 2, luminal A breast cancer that were treated with breast-conserving surgery and endocrine therapy alone, the incidence of local recurrence at 5 years was low with the omission of radiotherapy.

Y,,NEJM,Systemic Inflammation and Normocytic Anemia in DOCK11 Deficiency.,2023 Aug 10,10.1056/NEJMoa2210054,37342957,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence links genetic defects affecting actin-regulatory proteins to diseases with severe autoimmunity and autoinflammation, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Dedicator of cytokinesis 11 (DOCK11) activates the small Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), a central regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The role of DOCK11 in human immune-cell function and disease remains unknown. METHODS: We conducted genetic, immunologic, and molecular assays in four patients from four unrelated families who presented with infections, early-onset severe immune dysregulation, normocytic anemia of variable severity associated with anisopoikilocytosis, and developmental delay. Functional assays were performed in patient-derived cells, as well as in mouse and zebrafish models. RESULTS: We identified rare, X-linked germline mutations in DOCK11 in the patients, leading to a loss of protein expression in two patients and impaired CDC42 activation in all four patients. Patient-derived T cells did not form filopodia and showed abnormal migration. In addition, the patient-derived T cells, as well as the T cells from Dock11-knockout mice, showed overt activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines that were associated with an increased degree of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 (NFATc1). Anemia and aberrant erythrocyte morphologic features were recapitulated in a newly generated dock11-knockout zebrafish model, and anemia was amenable to rescue on ectopic expression of constitutively active CDC42. CONCLUSIONS: Germline hemizygous loss-of-function mutations affecting the actin regulator DOCK11 were shown to cause a previously unknown inborn error of hematopoiesis and immunity characterized by severe immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation, recurrent infections, and anemia.
