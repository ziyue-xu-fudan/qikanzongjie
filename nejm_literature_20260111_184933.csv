We conducted a phase 1-2, open-label study in which male participants up to 18 years of age with MPS II received weekly intravenous tividenofusp alfa for 24 weeks, followed by an 80-week safety extension and a 157-week open-label extension. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of tividenofusp alfa. Secondary objectives were to evaluate central nervous system and peripheral effects as assessed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urinary heparan sulfate levels, adaptive behavior (as assessed with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales), and liver volume. A total of 47 male participants were enrolled. At the 24-week primary analysis, all 47 participants reported at least one adverse event that emerged during the treatment period, most commonly infusion-related reactions. Pyrexia, urticaria, and vomiting were the most frequently reported symptoms of infusion-related reactions, occurring in more than 40% of the participants, despite routine premedication. Three participants had serious treatment-related adverse events; all continued to receive treatment. CSF and urinary heparan sulfate levels appeared to be reduced from baseline by 91% and 88%, respectively. Across all study periods, adverse events remained common. Reductions in heparan sulfate levels appeared to be maintained through week 153, adaptive behavior stabilized or improved, and liver volumes normalized or remained normal. In participants with MPS II, tividenofusp alfa treatment was commonly associated with adverse events. Heparan sulfate, the primary substrate that accumulates in the CSF and urine in persons with MPS II, appeared to decrease to levels within the range of unaffected children. A randomized trial is ongoing to further evaluate these effects.

Standard-dose rifampin has limited central nervous system penetration. Whether high-dose rifampin could improve survival outcomes is unknown. We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving adults with tuberculous meningitis in Indonesia, South Africa, and Uganda. We assigned persons with and those without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection to receive standard daily isoniazid, rifampin (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight), ethambutol, and pyrazinamide plus either additional rifampin (for a cumulative dose of 35 mg per kilogram; high-dose group) or matched placebo (standard-dose group) for 8 weeks; participants&#xa0;in both groups received standard therapy for the remainder of the 9-to-12-month treatment course. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality. A total of 499 participants were included in the intention-to-treat population (249 randomly assigned to the high-dose group and 250 to the standard-dose group), of whom 304 (60.9%) were persons living with HIV and 428 (85.8%) had definite or probable tuberculous meningitis. During 6 months of follow-up, 109 participants (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 44.6%) in the high-dose group and 100 participants (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 40.7%) in the standard-dose group died (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.54; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.25). Among the participants who died within 6 months, the median time to death was 13 days (interquartile range, 4 to 39) in the high-dose group and 24 days (interquartile range, 6 to 56) in the standard-dose group. Drug-induced liver injury occurred in 8.0% of the participants in the high-dose group and in 4.4% of those in the standard-dose group, but no deaths from drug-induced liver injury occurred. Among persons with tuberculous meningitis, no evidence of beneficial effect from high-dose rifampin was observed, and the potential for a harmful effect cannot be ruled out.

The effects on cardiovascular outcomes are uncertain. We conducted an active-comparator-controlled, double-blind, noninferiority trial in which patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a weekly subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide (up to 15 mg) or dulaglutide (1.5 mg), an agent that has been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. The primary end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke and was tested for noninferiority of tirzepatide to dulaglutide with a margin of 1.05 for the upper limit of the 95.3% confidence interval for the hazard ratio. An upper limit of less than 1.00 was considered to indicate superiority of tirzepatide to dulaglutide. A total of 13,299 patients underwent randomization; 134 were subsequently excluded because they did not meet inclusion criteria. The modified intention-to-treat population thus included 6586 patients in the tirzepatide group and 6579 in the dulaglutide group. The mean (&#xb1;SD) age of the patients was 64.1&#xb1;8.8 years, 29.0% were women, the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.6&#xb1;5.5, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.4&#xb1;0.9%, and the mean duration of diabetes was 14.7&#xb1;8.8 years. A primary end-point event occurred in 801 patients (12.2%) in the tirzepatide group and 862 (13.1%) in the dulaglutide group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95.3% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.01; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003 for noninferiority; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09 for superiority). The incidence of adverse events appeared to be similar in the two groups, although more gastrointestinal adverse events were observed in the tirzepatide group. Among patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, tirzepatide was noninferior to dulaglutide with respect to a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival, and the key secondary end point was disease-free survival (including survival free from noninvasive breast cancers and second primary nonbreast cancers). Other end points included overall survival, distant recurrence-free interval, brain metastasis-free interval, and safety. A total of 1635 patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive T-DXd (818 patients) or T-DM1 (817 patients). At the data-cutoff date, the median duration of follow-up was approximately 30 months in each group. Invasive-disease events or deaths were reported in 51 patients (6.2%) in the T-DXd group and 102 patients (12.5%) in the T-DM1 group (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.66; P<0.001); 3-year invasive disease-free survival was 92.4% and 83.7%, respectively.

The incidence of adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease was higher with T-DXd than with T-DM1 (9.6% vs. 1.6%). Two patients with interstitial lung disease in the T-DXd group died. In patients with high-risk, residual invasive HER2-positive breast cancer, postneoadjuvant T-DXd resulted in a significantly higher likelihood of invasive disease-free survival than T-DM1; toxic effects were mainly gastrointestinal and hematologic. An important identified risk of T-DXd is interstitial lung disease, which requires appropriate monitoring and management.

Secondary outcomes included duration of remission, disease-free survival, and overall survival. BE-CAR7 T cells were administered to 9 children, as well as to 2 adults who were treated under compassionate-use access arrangements. Lymphodepletion and BE-CAR7 infusions did not lead to unacceptable adverse events, and circulating CAR7 T cells were detected in all the patients. Complications included cytokine release syndrome of grades 1 through 4, transient rashes, multilineage cytopenia, and opportunistic infections. All the patients had complete morphologic remission with incomplete count recovery at day 28. Nine patients (82%) had deep remission (according to flow cytometry or polymerase-chain-reaction assay) that allowed them to proceed to stem-cell transplantation, and 2 patients with quantifiable minimal residual disease in bone marrow received palliative care. Transplantation eliminated remaining BE-CAR7 T cells and supported donor-derived, multilineage reconstitution. Viral reactivations were frequent, and 3 patients had clinically significant virus-related complications after transplantation. Overall, 7 of the 11 patients (64%) who received the investigational therapy were in ongoing remission at 3 to 36 months after transplantation, and leukemia with loss of CD7 expression was documented in 2 patients. Universal BE-CAR7 T cells induced leukemic remission in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell ALL, thus allowing successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in most of the patients.

The efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan, a C3 and C3b inhibitor, in persons with C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune-complex MPGN are unclear. We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving adolescents and adults with C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune-complex MPGN, including those with native kidney disease and those with disease recurrence after transplantation. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive pegcetacoplan or placebo. The primary end point was the log-transformed ratio of the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio at week 26 as compared with baseline. A total of 124 patients underwent randomization. The change in proteinuria (as measured by the log-transformed ratio to baseline in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio) was significantly greater with pegcetacoplan than with placebo (geometric mean of the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio, -67.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -74.9 to -57.2] vs. 2.9% [95% CI, -8.6 to 15.9]). The difference represents a relative reduction of 68.1% (95% CI, 57.3 to 76.2) as compared with placebo.

In this proof-of-concept, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral engasertib, a new, allosteric, selective AKT inhibitor, in patients with HHT. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive engasertib at a dose of 30 mg, engasertib at a dose of 40 mg, or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were the frequency and severity of adverse events. Key secondary outcomes included the frequency and duration of epistaxis. An open-label extension is ongoing. A total of 75 patients were assigned to 30-mg engasertib (24 patients), 40-mg engasertib (25 patients), or placebo (26 patients). Among the patients who received at least one dose of the trial regimen, the most common on-target adverse events associated with engasertib included mild-to-moderate rash (5 patients [21%] in the 30-mg engasertib group, 10 [42%] in the 40-mg engasertib group, and 2 [8%] in the placebo group) and mild-to-moderate hyperglycemia (3 patients [12%] in the 40-mg engasertib group and no patients in the other two groups), which were reversible.

No antiviral prophylaxis or treatment options are available. In a phase 2a, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned healthy adults to receive oral mosnodenvir once daily as a low dose (40-mg loading dose followed by 10-mg maintenance dose), medium dose (200 mg followed by 50 mg), or high dose (600 mg followed by 200 mg) or matched placebo. Loading doses were given for 5 days and maintenance doses for 21 days. In a controlled human infection model, participants received subcutaneous inoculation of an underattenuated dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) strain (rDEN3&#x394;30) on the day of the first maintenance dose (day 1). The primary efficacy end point was the DENV-3 RNA load, assessed as the log10 area under the concentration-time curve from day 1 (immediately before inoculation) through day 29 (AUCD1-29). The high-dose and placebo groups were compared in the primary end-point analysis. Safety, pharmacokinetic features, and virologic and serologic features were evaluated through day 85. The percentage of participants without signs of DENV-3 infection was 0% (0 of 6 participants) with the low dose of mosnodenvir, 17% (1 of 6) with the medium dose, and 60% (6 of 10) with the high dose, as compared with 0% (0 of 7) with placebo. High-dose mosnodenvir led to a significantly lower DENV-3 RNA load, assessed as the log10 AUCD1-29, than placebo (two-sided P<0.001 by tobit analysis of variance). In this small trial, mosnodenvir did not result in any serious adverse events. Plasma concentrations of mosnodenvir increased from day -5 to day 1 and were maintained through day 21.

Whether adding revascularization to intensive medical management would provide greater benefit than intensive medical management alone is unclear. We conducted two parallel, observer-blinded clinical trials that enrolled patients with high-grade (&#x2265;70%) asymptomatic carotid stenosis across 155 centers in five countries. The stenting trial compared intensive medical management alone (medical-therapy group) with carotid-artery stenting plus intensive medical management (stenting group); the endarterectomy trial compared intensive medical management alone (medical-therapy group) with carotid endarterectomy plus intensive medical management (endarterectomy group). The primary outcome was a composite of any stroke or death, assessed from randomization to 44 days, or ipsilateral ischemic stroke, assessed during the remaining follow-up period up to 4 years. A total of 1245 patients underwent randomization in the stenting trial and 1240 in the endarterectomy trial. In the stenting trial, the 4-year incidence of primary-outcome events was 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8 to 8.3) in the medical-therapy group and 2.8% (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.3) in the stenting group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02 for the absolute difference).

From day 0 to 44, in the stenting trial, no strokes or deaths occurred in the medical-therapy group and seven strokes and one death occurred in the stenting group; in the endarterectomy trial, three strokes occurred in the medical-therapy group and nine strokes occurred in the endarterectomy group. Among patients with high-grade stenosis without recent symptoms, the addition of stenting led to a lower risk of a composite of perioperative stroke or death or ipsilateral stroke within 4 years than intensive medical management alone.

Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) influenza vaccines have shown promising immunogenicity against influenza and an acceptable safety profile in a phase 1-2 trial. In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years to receive either a quadrivalent modRNA influenza vaccine (modRNA group) or a licensed inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (control group) during the 2022-2023 influenza season in the United States, South Africa, and the Philippines. The primary end point was relative efficacy, defined by the reduction in the percentage of participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with influenza-like illness at least 14 days after vaccination with the modRNA vaccine, as compared with the control vaccine, and analyzed for noninferiority and superiority. Immunogenicity was evaluated by means of a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. We assessed reactogenicity within 7 days after vaccination, adverse events through 1 month, and serious adverse events through 6 months. We assessed vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety in the modRNA group. A total of 18,476 participants underwent randomization: 9225 were assigned to receive the modRNA vaccine and 9251 to receive the control vaccine. The relative efficacy of the modRNA vaccine as compared with the control vaccine against influenza-like illness was 34.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.4 to 53.9) on the basis of 57 cases in the modRNA group and 87 cases in the control group, a finding that met the criteria for both noninferiority and superiority. Cases of influenza-like illness were caused by A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains but almost no B strains. The noninferiority of the antibody response on HAI assay was shown for influenza A strains but not for B strains. Primarily mild or moderate reactogenicity was observed in both vaccine groups but was reported more frequently in the modRNA group (overall local reactions, 70.1% vs. 43.1%; overall systemic events, 65.8% vs. 48.7%). Fever occurred in 5.6% of the participants in the modRNA group and in 1.7% of those in the control group. Adverse event profiles were similar in the two groups. The modRNA vaccine had statistically superior efficacy over the control vaccine, with greater immune responses to A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, but was associated with more reactogenicity events.

We conducted a cluster-randomized trial to assess a multicomponent intervention, the Active Prevention and Treatment of Maternal Sepsis (APT-Sepsis) program. This program was designed to support health care providers in achieving three goals: adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) hand-hygiene standards; adoption of evidence-based practices for maternal infection prevention and management; and early detection of sepsis and use of the FAST-M (fluids, antibiotics, source control, transfer if required, and monitoring) treatment bundle. Usual care was provided in the control group, along with dissemination of guidelines. The primary outcome was a composite of infection-related maternal death, infection-related near-miss event (events in which women survived a life-threatening complication), or severe infection-related illness (deep surgical-site, deep perineal, or body-cavity infection) among women who were pregnant or had recently been pregnant. We randomly assigned 59 health facilities (where 431,394 women gave birth during the trial) in Malawi and Uganda to the intervention group (30 clusters) or the usual-care group (29 clusters). A primary-outcome event occurred in 1.4% of the patients in the intervention group and in 1.9% of those in the usual-care group (risk ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.83; P<0.001). This effect was generally consistent between countries and among facilities of difference sizes and was sustained over time. Implementation of the APT-Sepsis program led to a significantly lower risk of a composite of infection-related maternal death, infection-related near-miss event, or severe infection-related illness than usual care.

Supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may have cardiovascular benefits in the general population, but efficacy among patients receiving hemodialysis is uncertain. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 26 sites in Canada and Australia, we assigned adult patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis to daily supplementation with fish oil (4 g of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [1.6 g of EPA and 0.8 g of DHA]) or corn-oil placebo. The primary end point was a composite of all serious cardiovascular events including sudden and nonsudden cardiac death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease leading to amputation, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. Secondary end points included extension of the primary end point to include noncardiac causes of death, the individual components of the primary end point, and a first cardiovascular event or death from any cause. Between November 28, 2013, and July 22, 2019, a total of 1228 participants underwent randomization; 610 were assigned to the fish-oil group and 618 to the placebo group. During 3.5 years of follow-up, the rate of serious cardiovascular events was significantly lower in the fish-oil group than in the placebo group (0.31 vs. 0.61 per 1000 patient-days; hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47 to 0.70; P<0.001). The rate of the extended primary end point that included noncardiac causes of death appeared to be lower in the fish-oil group than in the placebo group, with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.90). The hazard ratio for cardiac death was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.75); for fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.80); for peripheral vascular disease leading to amputation, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.86); for fatal and nonfatal stroke, 0.37 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.76); and for a first cardiovascular event or death from any cause, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.87). Adherence to the trial regimen and the incidence of adverse events did not differ meaningfully between the groups.

Atacicept is a native human transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin-ligand interactor (TACI)-Fc fusion protein that inhibits two key immunoregulatory cytokines - B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) - that are thought to be central to the pathophysiology of IgA nephropathy. In this ongoing, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients with IgA nephropathy in a 1:1 ratio to receive atacicept at a dose of 150 mg once weekly, administered subcutaneously by patients at home, or matching placebo. The primary end point was the percentage change from baseline in the 24-hour urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio at week 36. Safety was also evaluated. A total of 203 patients were included in the prespecified interim analysis: 106 patients in the atacicept group and 97 in the placebo group.

A replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored vaccine encoding a Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein complex, rVSV&#x394;G-LASV-GPC, has been developed, but data on its safety and immunogenicity are limited. In this phase 1, double-blind trial conducted in the United States and Liberia, we randomly assigned healthy adults (18 to 50 years of age) to receive rVSV&#x394;G-LASV-GPC or placebo intramuscularly. Participants received a single vaccine dose of 2&#xd7;104 plaque-forming units (PFU), 2&#xd7;105 PFU, 2&#xd7;106 PFU, or 2&#xd7;107 PFU or placebo or received two vaccine doses of 2&#xd7;107 PFU or placebo, within a window of 6 to 20 weeks. The side-effect profile was assessed according to the incidence of solicited and unsolicited adverse events (primary end point). Because Lassa fever can cause sensorineural hearing loss, hearing acuity was measured before and after the injection. Secondary end points were levels of binding antibodies against LASV glycoprotein, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccine vector-derived viral RNA and PFU in plasma, urine, and saliva. A total of 114 adults were enrolled. No serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported. The vaccine caused minimal local reactions and dose-dependent, mild-to-severe early-onset systemic reactogenicity events that were transient. No hearing loss was detected. All doses induced robust long-lasting cellular and humoral (binding and neutralizing) responses that cross-reacted against common LASV lineages. No infectious vaccine virus particles were found in plasma, urine, or saliva. The rVSV&#x394;G-LASV-GPC vaccine resulted in transient local and systemic reactogenicity events but no hearing loss or serious adverse events. The vaccine had immunogenicity over a wide dose range in healthy adults in the United States and Liberia.

We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving adults and adolescents (&#x2265;12 years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, as defined by all the following: a total body-surface area of psoriasis involvement of at least 10%, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of at least 12 (range, 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating a greater extent or severity of psoriasis), and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 3 (range, 0 [clear skin] to 4 [severe disease]). Participants were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive icotrokinra at a dose of 200 mg once daily through week 24 or placebo through week 16 followed by transition to icotrokinra.

Because deaths from prostate cancer are expected to rise worldwide owing to increased life expectancy and population growth, a final analysis of the long-term outcomes of prostate cancer screening is essential to understanding the benefits and harms of PSA testing. We updated the findings from ERSPC, a multicenter, randomized study conducted across eight European countries with a focus on a predefined core age group of 162,236 men who were 55 to 69 years of age at the time of randomization. Participants were randomly assigned to the screening group and offered repeated PSA testing or to the control group and not invited for screening. The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality. After a median follow-up of 23 years, prostate cancer mortality was 13% lower in the screening group (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 0.95), and the absolute risk reduction was 0.22% (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.34). The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was higher in the screening group than in the control group (rate ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.33). At a median of 23 years of follow-up, one death from prostate cancer was prevented for every 456 men (95% CI, 306 to 943) who were invited for screening, and one death from prostate cancer was averted for every 12 men (95% CI, 8 to 26) in whom prostate cancer was diagnosed, as compared with one death from prostate cancer prevented for every 628 men (95% CI, 419 to 1481) and one death averted for every 18 men (95% CI, 12 to 45) at 16 years of follow-up. Long-term follow-up confirms a sustained reduction in deaths from prostate cancer with PSA testing, alongside an improved harm-benefit ratio. Future screening strategies should adopt risk-based approaches to minimize overdiagnosis while maintaining clinical benefits.

In an earlier analysis of data from Australia, SDD did not result in a lower incidence of in-hospital death than standard care, but data from the full international trial are needed. We randomly assigned ICUs in Australia and Canada to use SDD or to continue standard care for two 12-month periods in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Patients in the SDD group received specific oral and gastric antimicrobial interventions for the duration of ventilation and an intravenous antibiotic agent for the first 4 days after enrollment. All other patients in the ICU were included in an observational ecologic assessment. Previously reported data from Australia are now combined with data from Canada. The primary outcome was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days. The secondary clinical outcomes, assessed at 90 days, were death in the ICU and the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and hospitalization. Microbiologic secondary outcomes included new positive cultures for bloodstream infections and antibiotic-resistant organisms.

Despite advances in molecular diagnostic techniques, the effect of rare diseases on the diagnosis of common diseases in research and clinical trials has not been comprehensively investigated. We used exome- and genome-sequencing data from participants in the U.K. Biobank, a research study, and five clinical trials involving patients who had received a primary diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or atopic dermatitis to assess the incidence of monogenic rare diseases that often manifest with clinical symptoms overlapping with those of these common diseases. We identified 153 U.K. Biobank participants who carried a rare variant that contributes to a molecular diagnosis of a monogenic disorder - 53 of 1850 (2.86%) with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, 75 of 6681 (1.12%) with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, and 25 of 998 (2.50%) with a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. We replicated the findings regarding such rare disease-causing variants in two independent cohorts - one including patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and the other patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease - who had undergone genome sequencing for research and for clinical trials, respectively. By combining genome and transcriptome analyses, we showed that molecular diagnosis can potentially elucidate mechanisms of inadequate response to therapeutic intervention. Our study shows the value of systematic genome sequencing in understanding the phenotypic heterogeneity of common diseases and identifying failure to diagnose rare diseases and highlights the benefits of deep molecular phenotyping in clinical trials and patient care.

Infants 1 to 11 months of age received, in doses of 20 mg per kilogram of body weight, placebo every 3 months (control group); azithromycin at two quarterly visits from January through June and placebo at two quarterly visits from July through December (twice-yearly azithromycin group); or azithromycin every 3 months (quarterly azithromycin group). The primary outcome was death within 3 months after eligibility had been confirmed, analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. From December 2020 through December 2022, a total of 1151 villages were enrolled in the trial; 386 villages were randomly assigned to the control group, 511 to the twice-yearly azithromycin group, and 254 to the quarterly azithromycin group. Among all the villages, 149,090 infants received at least one dose of placebo or azithromycin, with a total of 82,600 person-years of follow-up; 968 deaths were recorded. Mortality was 11.9 deaths per 1000 person-years at risk in the control group, 11.8 deaths per 1000 person-years in the twice-yearly azithromycin group (incidence rate ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.19), and 11.3 deaths per 1000 person-years in the quarterly azithromycin group (incidence rate ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.15). Adverse events were rare, and the percentages of infants with&#xa0;adverse events were similar in the three groups. Mortality among untreated children 12 to 59 months of age was similar across groups. Mass administration of azithromycin in Mali, limited to infants 1 to 11 months of age, did not result in lower infant or child mortality than placebo, regardless of whether azithromycin was delivered twice yearly or quarterly.

The primary efficacy end points were overall survival and event-free survival (defined as survival free from rescue allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, reinitiation of enzyme-replacement therapy, and additional gene therapy). Secondary end points included no receipt of immunoglobulin-replacement therapy, the presence of protective titers to tetanus or pneumococcal vaccines, and sustained discontinuation of fungal or viral prophylaxis. We now report the long-term results from this cohort representing 474 patient-years of follow-up, with a median follow-up of 7.5 years. We treated 62 patients with ADA-SCID in the United States (33 patients) and the United Kingdom (29 patients). Overall survival was 100%, and event-free survival was 95% (59 of 62 patients). All 59 patients who had successful gene-marked engraftment at 6 months have continued not to receive enzyme-replacement therapy and have had stable gene marking, ADA enzyme activity, metabolic detoxification, and immune reconstitution through the last follow-up; 58 of these patients (98%) discontinued IgG replacement therapy and have evidence of a robust response to vaccinations. None of the patients had a leukoproliferative event or clonal expansion. These long-term findings in a large patient cohort show the sustained clinical efficacy and safety of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem-cell lentiviral gene therapy for ADA-SCID, indicating that it is a curative treatment.

The primary end point at week 52 was a response on the modified SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI-4), with a response on this composite measure defined as a reduction of at least 4 points in the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) score (ranging from 0 to 105, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity), no new disease activity as measured on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index, and no worsening in the Physician's Global Assessment score. Of 433 adults screened, 335 underwent randomization (167 to the telitacicept group and 168 to the placebo group). At week 52, significantly more participants receiving telitacicept had a response on the modified SRI-4 than those receiving placebo (67.1% vs. 32.7%; adjusted difference, 34.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.3 to 44.7; P<0.001).

Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy was performed at the time of surgery and was followed by examination of frozen sections. Patients who had negative sentinel lymph nodes were intraoperatively assigned in a 1:1 ratio not to undergo pelvic lymphadenectomy (the biopsy-only group) or to undergo lymphadenectomy (the lymphadenectomy group). All the patients underwent hysterectomy, and adjuvant therapy was provided according to a unified protocol. The primary end point was disease-free survival at 3 years, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 5 percentage points in the upper limit of the confidence interval for the difference between the lymphadenectomy group and the biopsy-only group. Secondary end points included retroperitoneal nodal recurrence, cancer-specific survival, and surgical complications. A total of 838 patients underwent randomization: 420 patients were assigned to the biopsy-only group and 418 to the lymphadenectomy group. The median follow-up was 62.8 months.

We conducted an open-label, single-group, first-in-human registrational study to evaluate DB-OTO. Children with OTOF variants and profound deafness (defined by an average audiometric threshold of >90 decibel hearing level [dB HL], indicating an inability to hear a gas-powered lawn mower) received an intracochlear infusion of DB-OTO (7.2&#xd7;1012 vector genomes per ear) in one or both ears. The primary efficacy end point was an average threshold on behavioral pure-tone audiometry (PTA) at week 24 of 70 dB HL or less, a clinical standard that generally avoids cochlear implantation and enables natural acoustic hearing. A key secondary end point was the presence of an auditory brain-stem response to a click stimulus at a threshold at or below 90 dB normalized hearing level (db nHL) at week 24. Safety assessments included adverse events, laboratory results, and vestibular testing. A total of 12 children have been enrolled in the study.

Children 2 to 15 years of age were enrolled from households in 50 clusters of five-by-five city blocks. Households in 25 clusters received an annual application of targeted indoor residual spraying (intervention) before each season of aedes-borne disease (July through December).

Community effects were assessed with the use of geolocated national surveillance data. A total of 4461 children were monitored for up to three seasons (2021, 2022, and 2023). The indoor density of A. aegypti mosquitoes was 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51 to 65) lower with the intervention than with control. A total of 422 cases of aedes-borne disease were confirmed, primarily dengue in 2023.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive add-on therapy with subcutaneous sotatercept (starting dose, 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight; escalated to target dose, 0.7 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 21 days. The primary end point was clinical worsening, a composite of death from any cause, unplanned hospitalization lasting at least 24 hours for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension, atrial septostomy, lung transplantation, or deterioration in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. The trial was stopped early owing to loss of clinical equipoise after the reporting of positive results from previous sotatercept trials. A total of 320 patients were included (160 each in the sotatercept and placebo groups). The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 months. At least one primary end-point event occurred in 17 patients (10.6%) in the sotatercept group and in 59 patients (36.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.41; P<0.001). Deterioration in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in 8 patients (5.0%) in the sotatercept group and in 46 patients (28.8%) in the placebo group; unplanned hospitalization for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in 3 patients (1.9%) and 14 patients (8.8%), respectively; and death from any cause occurred in 7 patients (4.4%) and 6 patients (3.8%). No cases of atrial septostomy or lung transplantation occurred. The most common adverse events with sotatercept were epistaxis (31.9%) and telangiectasia (26.2%). Among adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension who had received the diagnosis less than 1 year earlier, the addition of sotatercept to background therapy resulted in a lower risk of clinical worsening than placebo.

Large trials are needed to assess safety and effectiveness. For this open-label, randomized, two-by-two factorial trial at 20 sites in the United Kingdom, we enrolled participants with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis who had frequent pulmonary exacerbations and daily sputum production. Current smokers and persons who had recently received mucoactive treatments were excluded. All participants received standard care and were also assigned either to one of three mucoactive-drug groups - hypertonic saline (the hypertonic-saline group), hypertonic saline and carbocisteine (the combination group), or carbocisteine (the carbocisteine group) - or to standard care alone. The comparisons were between hypertonic saline and no hypertonic saline and between carbocisteine and no carbocisteine, with each category consisting of two groups. The primary outcome was the number of pulmonary exacerbations over a 52-week period. Key secondary outcomes were scores on disease-specific health-related quality-of-life assessments, time to next pulmonary exacerbation, and safety. A total of 288 participants underwent randomization. No treatment interactions were found. The mean number of adjudicated fully qualifying pulmonary exacerbations over the 52-week period was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95) with hypertonic saline as compared with 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.19) with no hypertonic saline (adjusted between-group difference in the means, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.57 to 0.07; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12]) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.06) with carbocisteine as compared with 0.90 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.09) with no carbocisteine (adjusted between-group difference in the means, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.36 to 0.28; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.81]). Secondary outcomes and the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, were similar across the groups.

Nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) is an investigational in vivo therapy based on CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated Cas9 endonuclease) that is designed to reduce serum TTR levels through selective inactivation of TTR in the liver. In this phase 1, open-label study, we administered one infusion of nex-z to patients with ATTRv-PN. Primary objectives included assessment of the safety and pharmacodynamics of nex-z. Secondary end points included changes in the familial amyloid polyneuropathy stage, polyneuropathy disability score, serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) level, modified body-mass index (modified BMI, defined as the conventional BMI [weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters] multiplied by the albumin level in grams per liter), and modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment). A total of 36 patients received nex-z; the mean follow-up was 27 months. The mean percent change from baseline in the serum TTR level was -90% at day 28, which was sustained through month 24 (-92%). Treatment-related adverse events included transient infusion-related reactions (in 21 patients), decreased thyroxine level without hypothyroidism or elevated thyrotropin level (in 8), and headache (in 4). One participant died from cardiac amyloidosis, and one withdrew owing to progressive decline in motor function. Serious adverse events were reported in 11 patients. At month 24, the familial amyloid polyneuropathy stage and polyneuropathy disability score remained stable in 29 and 27 patients, respectively; improved in 2 and 5, respectively; and worsened in 2 and 2, respectively. The mean change in the serum NfL level was -9.0 pg per milliliter, and the change in the modified BMI was 24.7. The mean change from baseline in the mNIS+7 was -8.5. A single administration of nex-z in patients with ATTRv-PN was associated with rapid, deep, and durable reductions in serum TTR levels.

We leveraged the traditional practice of mothers carrying children on their backs in cloth wraps to assess whether treating the wraps with an insect repellent might provide a layer of protection against malaria. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Uganda, we enrolled adult women with a child who was 6 to 18 months of age. The mother-child pairs were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use permethrin-treated wraps (intervention group) or sham-treated wraps (control group). The wraps underwent retreatment every 4 weeks. All the participants received a new, pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticide-treated bed net. The participants visited the trial clinics every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and made unscheduled visits in the case of febrile illness in the children. The primary outcome was clinical malaria in the children, as defined by fever and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. From June 2022 through April 2024, a total of 419 mother-child pairs were screened, and 400 underwent randomization; 200 pairs were assigned to the intervention group and 200 to the control group. Clinic attendance was high (5194 of 5200 planned visits [99.9%] were attended), and no participants were lost to follow-up. The incidence rate of clinical malaria was 0.73 cases per 100 person-weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 1.02) in the intervention group and 2.14 cases per 100 person-weeks (95% CI, 1.73 to 2.62) in the control group (incidence rate ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.51; P<0.001).

We followed a retrospective cohort of 3,724,623 children born between 1996 and 2016 in six U.S. health care systems and Ontario, Canada, until the earliest of cancer or benign-tumor diagnosis, death, end of health care coverage, an age of 21 years, or December 31, 2017. Radiation doses to active bone marrow from medical imaging were quantified. Associations between hematologic cancers and cumulative radiation exposure (vs. no exposure), with a lag of 6 months, were estimated with the use of continuous-time hazards models. During 35,715,325 person-years of follow-up (mean, 10.1 years per person), 2961 hematologic cancers were diagnosed, primarily lymphoid cancers (2349 [79.3%]), myeloid cancers or acute leukemia (460 [15.5%]), and histiocytic- or dendritic-cell cancers (129 [4.4%]). The mean (&#xb1;SD) exposure among children exposed to at least 1 mGy was 14.0&#xb1;23.1 mGy overall (for comparison, 13.7 mGy was the exposure from one computed tomographic [CT] scan of the head) and 24.5&#xb1;36.4 mGy among children with hematologic cancer. Cancer risk increased with cumulative dose, with a relative risk (vs. no exposure) of 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 1.78) for 1 to less than 5 mGy, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.43) for 15 to less than 20 mGy, and 3.59 (95% CI, 2.22 to 5.44) for 50 to less than 100 mGy. The cumulative radiation dose to bone marrow was associated with an increased risk of all hematologic cancers (excess relative risk per 100 mGy, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.70 to 3.51; P<0.001]; relative risk for 30 vs. 0 mGy, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.51 to 2.05]) and most tumor subtypes. The excess cumulative incidence of hematologic cancers by 21 years of age among children exposed to at least 30 mGy (mean, 57 mGy) was 25.6 per 10,000. We estimated that, in our cohort, 10.1% (95% CI, 5.8 to 14.2) of hematologic cancers may have been attributable to radiation exposure from medical imaging, with higher risks from the higher-dose medical-imaging tests such as CT. Our study suggests an association between exposure to radiation from medical imaging and a small but significantly increased risk of hematologic cancer among children and adolescents.

The disorder is treated with shunt surgery, but the effectiveness of shunting is unclear. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving participants selected for shunt surgery on the basis of gait-velocity improvement with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Participants were randomly assigned to an open-shunt valve setting (opening pressure, 110 mm of water) or a placebo valve setting (opening pressure, >400 mm of water) of a noninvasively adjustable shunt. The primary outcome was the change in gait velocity 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the change at 3 months in the Tinetti scale total score (range, 0 to 28; lower scores indicate worse gait and balance), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (range, 0 to 30; lower scores indicate worse cognition), and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse urinary incontinence). A total of 99 participants underwent randomization and received the assigned intervention. At 3 months, gait velocity had increased in the open-shunt group (mean [&#xb1;SD] change, 0.23&#xb1;0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants) and was unchanged in the placebo group (mean change, 0.03&#xb1;0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants), resulting in a treatment difference of 0.21 m per second (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.31; P<0.001). A significantly greater improvement in the open-shunt group than the placebo group was seen for the Tinetti scale score (mean change, 2.9 points vs. 0.5 points; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) but not the MoCA score (1.3 points vs. 0.3 points) or the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (-3.3 points vs. -1.5 points). The results regarding adverse events were mixed, with more participants in the placebo group reporting falls (46% vs. 24%), an equal percentage having cerebral bleeding (2% in both groups), and more participants in the open-shunt group having subdural bleeding (12% vs. 2%) and positional headaches (59% vs. 28%). Among participants with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus who had a response to temporary CSF drainage, shunting resulted in significant improvements at 3 months in gait velocity and a measure of gait and balance but not in measures of cognition or incontinence.

We report key aspects of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of MVD during this outbreak, as well as the overall response to the outbreak. We performed a retrospective epidemiologic and clinical analysis of data compiled across all pillars of the outbreak response and a case-series analysis to characterize clinical features, disease progression, and outcomes among patients who received supportive care and investigational therapeutic agents. Among the 6340 patients with suspected MVD who underwent testing, 66 had laboratory-confirmed MVD, 51 (77%) of whom were health care workers. The median estimated incubation period was 10 days (interquartile range, 8 to 13), and symptom onset occurred a median of 2 days (interquartile range, 1 to 3) before hospital admission. The results of epidemiologic investigations were highly suggestive of a zoonotic origin of the outbreak: an index patient was identified who had been exposed to Egyptian fruit bats at a mining site. The case fatality rate in the outbreak was 23% (15 deaths among 66 patients). Remdesivir and the monoclonal antibody MBP091 were used under expanded access and clinical trial protocols. In addition, 1710 frontline workers and high-risk contacts received the chimpanzee adenovirus 3-vectored vaccine ChAd3-MARV under emergency use authorization in a phase 2 clinical trial. Implementation of containment measures, advanced supportive care, and access to investigational countermeasures may have contributed to reduced mortality from MVD in this outbreak.

HIT has been characterized as a polyclonal immune response; however, studies of other rare anti-PF4 disorders have identified clonally restricted antibodies. In this study, we investigated the clonality of pathogenic HIT antibodies. Antibodies against PF4-heparin were affinity-purified with the use of PF4-heparin beads from serum samples obtained from nine patients with clinically and serologically confirmed HIT. Antibody clonality was assessed by means of immunofixation electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Antibody binding to PF4 was evaluated by an enzyme immunoassay, and functional platelet activation was evaluated with the use of a P-selectin expression assay. HIT antibody epitopes were mapped in two patients with the use of a PF4 mutant library. Serum samples from all nine patients with HIT were positive for platelet-activating antibodies against PF4-heparin by enzyme immunoassay, as well as the P-selectin expression assay, and six samples (67%) had a monoclonal antibody detectable by immunofixation electrophoresis. The affinity-purified antibodies against PF4-heparin from all nine samples activated platelets in the P-selectin expression assay, and mass spectrometry showed monoclonality. After affinity purification, antibody-depleted serum samples lost binding activity in the enzyme immunoassay and functional activity in the P-selectin expression assay, which confirmed the removal of the pathogenic antibodies. The epitopes on PF4 targeted by anti-PF4-heparin antibodies from serum samples were the same as those targeted by the affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies. The pathogenic antibodies in all nine patients with HIT were found to be monoclonal.

Molgramostim is a formulation of inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF, but its efficacy and safety in patients with aPAP have not been studied sufficiently. In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with aPAP to receive molgramostim at a dose of 300 &#x3bc;g or placebo once daily for 48 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 24 in the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which was adjusted for hemoglobin concentration and expressed as a percentage of the predicted value. Secondary end points adjusted for multiplicity were the change from baseline in DLCO at 48 weeks and the change from baseline in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total (SGRQ-T) and activity (SGRQ-A) scores (scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better quality of life) and in exercise capacity at 24 and 48 weeks. A total of 164 patients underwent randomization: 81 were assigned to receive molgramostim and 83 to receive placebo. The least-squares mean change in DLCO from baseline to week 24 was 9.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.3 to 12.3) with molgramostim and 3.8 percentage points (95% CI, 1.4 to 6.3) with placebo (estimated treatment difference, 6.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.5 to 9.4; P<0.001). The least-squares mean change in DLCO from baseline to week 48 was 11.6 percentage points (95% CI, 8.7 to 14.5) with molgramostim and 4.7 percentage points (95% CI, 1.8 to 7.6) with placebo (P<0.001), and the least-squares mean change in the SGRQ-T score at week 24 was -11.5 points (95% CI, -15.0 to -8.0) and -4.9 points (95% CI, -8.3 to -1.5), respectively (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). No significant between-group difference in the change in SGRQ-A score was observed at 24 weeks, so no statistical inference was drawn with respect to subsequent secondary end points. The percentage of patients with at least one adverse event and the percentage with at least one serious adverse event were similar in the two groups. Once-daily inhaled molgramostim led to a greater increase in pulmonary gas transfer than placebo in patients with aPAP.

The safety and efficacy of risdiplam in presymptomatic disease are unclear. We conducted an open-label study of daily oral risdiplam (with the dose adjusted to 0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight) in infants 1 day (birth) to 42 days of age with genetically diagnosed SMA but without strongly suggestive clinical signs or symptoms. The primary outcome, assessed in infants with two SMN2 copies and a baseline ulnar compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude of at least 1.5 mV, was the ability to sit without support at month 12. Natural history studies have shown that the majority of infants with two SMN2 copies who are untreated would have a severe SMA phenotype (type 1), would never sit independently, would receive permanent ventilation and feeding support, or would die by 13 months of age. Secondary outcomes that were assessed over a period of 24 months included survival, ventilatory support, motor milestones, the development of clinically manifested SMA, feeding, and growth. A total of 26 infants with two, three, or four or more copies of SMN2 were enrolled. After 12 months of treatment, 21 infants (81%) could sit unsupported for 30 seconds, 14 (54%) could stand alone, and 11 (42%) could walk alone. A total of 4 of 5 infants (80%; 95% confidence interval, 28 to 100) with two SMN2 copies and a baseline ulnar CMAP amplitude of at least 1.5 mV were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds. Three infants were withdrawn from the study by a parent or caregiver after the month 12 visit. Of 23 infants who completed 24 months of treatment, all were alive without the use of permanent ventilation or feeding support. Over a period of 24 months, nine treatment-related adverse events were reported in 7 infants; none of these events were serious. Infants up to 6 weeks of age with genetically diagnosed SMA who were treated with risdiplam before the development of clinical signs or symptoms appeared to have better functional and survival outcomes at 12 and 24 months than untreated infants in natural history studies. Larger, controlled studies with longer follow-up are needed to further understand the relative efficacy and safety of presymptomatic treatment of SMA with risdiplam. (Funded by F.

Current treatment guidelines are based on weak evidence. We enrolled persons (excluding pregnant persons) in Madagascar who had clinically suspected bubonic plague during 2020-2024. Using an open-label noninferiority design, we compared two treatments included in the national plague guidelines: oral ciprofloxacin for 10 days (ciprofloxacin monotherapy) or injectable aminoglycoside for 3 days followed by oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days (aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin). The primary end point was treatment failure on day 11, with treatment failure defined as death, fever, secondary pneumonic plague, or alternative or prolonged plague treatment. To show noninferiority of ciprofloxacin monotherapy among patients with laboratory-confirmed or probable infections, the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval around the risk difference had to be less than 15 percentage points. A total of 933 patients underwent screening; 450 patients with suspected bubonic plague were enrolled and underwent randomization. A total of 220 patients (110 per group) had confirmed infection, and 2 (1 per group) had probable infection. Of the patients who underwent randomization, 53.2% were male, and the median age was 14 years (range, 2 to 72). Ciprofloxacin monotherapy was noninferior to aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin therapy: among the patients with confirmed or probable infection, treatment failure occurred in 9.0% (10 of 111 patients) in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 8.1% (9 of 111 patients) in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group (difference, 0.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.0 to 7.8). Noninferiority was consistent in other prespecified analysis populations. A total of 5 patients in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 4 patients in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group died, and secondary pneumonic plague developed in 3 patients in each group. The incidence of adverse events among patients with confirmed or probable infections was similar in the two groups - 18.0% in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 18.9% in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group had adverse events, and 7.2% and 5.4%, respectively, had serious adverse events. Oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy for 10 days was noninferior to an aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin sequential combination for the treatment of patients with bubonic plague.

Whether mass administration of ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug that also kills mosquitoes feeding on treated persons, can reduce malaria transmission is unclear. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in Kwale, a county in coastal Kenya in which malaria is highly endemic and coverage and use of insecticide-treated nets are high. Clusters of household areas were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive mass administration of ivermectin (400 &#x3bc;g per kilogram of body weight) or albendazole (400 mg, active control) once a month for 3 consecutive months at the beginning of the ""short rains"" season. Children 5 to 15 years of age were tested for malaria infection monthly for 6 months after the first round of treatment. The two primary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of malaria infection (assessed among children 5 to 15 years of age) and of adverse events (assessed among all eligible participants). Analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 84 clusters comprising 28,932 eligible participants underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics of the participants were similar in the trial groups. Six months after the first round of treatment, the incidence of malaria infection was 2.20 per child-year at risk in the ivermectin group and 2.66 per child-year at risk in the albendazole group; the adjusted incidence rate ratio (ivermectin vs. albendazole) was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). The incidence of serious adverse events per 100 treatments did not differ significantly between the trial groups (incidence rate ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.91). Among children 5 to 15 years of age who were living in an area with high coverage and use of bed nets, ivermectin, administered once a month for 3 consecutive months, resulted in a 26% lower incidence of malaria infection than albendazole. No safety concerns were identified.

Mitochondrial donation by pronuclear transfer involves transplantation of nuclear genome from a fertilized egg from the affected woman to an enucleated fertilized egg donated by an unaffected woman. Thus, pronuclear transfer offers affected women the potential to have a genetically related child with a reduced risk of mtDNA disease. We offered mitochondrial donation (by pronuclear transfer) or preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) to a series of women with pathogenic mtDNA variants who sought to reduce the transmission of these variants to their children. Patients with heteroplasmy (variants present in a proportion of copies of mtDNA) were offered PGT, and patients with homoplasmy (variants present in all copies of mtDNA) or elevated heteroplasmy were offered pronuclear transfer. Clinical pregnancies were confirmed in 8 of 22 patients (36%) and 16 of 39 patients (41%) who underwent an intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedure for pronuclear transfer or for PGT, respectively. Pronuclear transfer resulted in 8 live births and 1 ongoing pregnancy. PGT resulted in 18 live births. Heteroplasmy levels in the blood of the 8 infants whose mothers underwent pronuclear transfer ranged from undetectable to 16%.

It is commonly prescribed at discharge to reduce symptoms, but evidence to support this practice is limited. We conducted a double-blind, randomized superiority trial involving children 6 months to less than 18 years of age with acute gastroenteritis-associated vomiting in six pediatric emergency departments. Caregivers were provided with six doses of oral ondansetron or placebo to administer in response to ongoing vomiting during the first 48 hours after enrollment. The primary outcome was moderate-to-severe gastroenteritis, defined by a score of 9 or higher on the modified Vesikari scale (scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater severity), during the 7 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included the presence of vomiting, the duration of vomiting (defined as the time from enrollment to the last vomiting episode), the number of vomiting episodes within 48 hours after enrollment, unscheduled physician visits within 7 days after enrollment, and receipt of intravenous fluids. A total of 1030 children underwent randomization. Moderate-to-severe gastroenteritis occurred in 5.1% (23 of 452 participants for whom data were available) in the ondansetron group and 12.5% (55 of 441) in the placebo group (unadjusted risk difference, -7.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.2 to -3.7). After adjustment for site, weight, and missing data, ondansetron was associated with a lower risk of moderate-to-severe gastroenteritis than placebo (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.60). Although we did not observe any meaningful difference between the groups in the presence or median duration of vomiting, the total number of vomiting episodes within 48 hours after enrollment was lower with ondansetron than with placebo (adjusted rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.87). The percentage of children who had unscheduled health care visits and the percentage who received intravenous fluids after enrollment did not differ substantially between the groups. The incidence of adverse events also did not differ meaningfully between the groups (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.61).

Vascular reocclusion may occur after intravenous thrombolysis and may be preventable with an antiplatelet agent within the first 24 hours after thrombolysis. Tirofiban, a platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor antagonist, has reduced macrovascular reocclusion in experimental models. In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 38 centers in China, we assigned patients with acute ischemic noncardioembolic stroke who presented within 4.5 hours after stroke onset and who were not eligible for thrombectomy to receive a 24-hour intravenous infusion of tirofiban or placebo within 60 minutes after intravenous thrombolysis. The primary efficacy outcome was an excellent functional outcome, defined as a score of 0 to 1 on the modified Rankin scale, at 90 days. The safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and death at 90 days. A total of 414 patients were assigned to receive tirofiban and 418 to receive placebo. Thrombolytic agents included alteplase (in 75% of the patients) and tenecteplase (in 25%). At 90 days, a score of 0 to 1 on the modified Rankin scale was reported in a higher percentage of patients in the tirofiban group than in the placebo group (65.9% vs. 54.9%; risk ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.34; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1.7% of the patients in the tirofiban group and none in the placebo group. Mortality at 90 days was 4.1% in the tirofiban group and 3.8% in the placebo group. In patients with acute ischemic noncardioembolic stroke who underwent thrombolysis within 4.5 hours after onset, early tirofiban increased the likelihood of an excellent functional outcome. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was low but higher with tirofiban than placebo.

The primary end point, tested for noninferiority (noninferiority margin, 0.4 percentage points), was the change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level at 52 weeks. A total of 795 participants underwent randomization. The mean glycated hemoglobin level decreased from 8.20% at baseline to 7.05% at week 52 with efsitora (least-squares mean change, -1.19 percentage points) and from 8.28% to 7.08% with glargine (least-squares mean change, -1.16 percentage points); the estimated between-group difference of -0.03 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.18 to 0.12) confirmed the noninferiority of efsitora to glargine. Superiority was not shown (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68). The rate of combined clinically significant hypoglycemia (glucose level, <54 mg per deciliter) or severe hypoglycemia (level 3; requiring assistance for treatment) was lower with efsitora than with glargine (0.50 events per participant-year of exposure with efsitora vs. 0.88 with glargine; estimated rate ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.84]). At week 52, the mean total weekly insulin dose was 289.1 U per week with efsitora and 332.8 U per week with glargine (estimated between-group difference, -43.7 U per week; 95% CI, -62.4 to -25.0); the median number of dose adjustments needed was 2 with efsitora and 8 with glargine. In adults with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received insulin,&#xa0;once-weekly efsitora, administered in a fixed-dose regimen, was noninferior to once-daily glargine in reducing glycated hemoglobin levels.

In part A, participants received a half dose of zimislecel (0.4&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;109 cells) as a single infusion into the portal vein, with an option for a second half dose within 2 years. In parts B and C, participants received a full dose of zimislecel (0.8&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;109 cells) as a single infusion. All the participants also received glucocorticoid-free immunosuppressive therapy. The primary end point in part A was safety. The primary end point in part C was freedom from severe hypoglycemic events during days 90 through 365, with a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 7% or a decrease of at least 1 percentage point from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level at one or more time points between days 180 and 365. Secondary end points in part C included safety and insulin independence between days 180 and 365. Assessment of the primary and secondary end points in part C involved the participants who received the full dose of zimislecel as a single infusion in part B or C. Detection of serum C-peptide during a 4-hour mixed-meal tolerance test was used to assess engraftment and islet function. All the analyses were interim and not prespecified. A total of 14 participants (2 in part A and 12 in parts B and C) completed at least 12 months of follow-up and were included in the analyses. C-peptide was undetectable at baseline in all 14 participants. After zimislecel infusion, all the participants had engraftment and islet function, as evidenced by the detection of C-peptide. Neutropenia was the most common serious adverse event, occurring in 3 participants. Two deaths occurred - one caused by cryptococcal meningitis and one by severe dementia with agitation owing to the progression of preexisting neurocognitive impairment. All 12 participants in parts B and C were free of severe hypoglycemic events and had a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 7%; these participants spent more than 70% of the time in the target glucose range (70 to 180 mg per deciliter).

The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor and an antimetabolite remains standard care for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in these patients. Data from two randomized trials have suggested that post-transplantation cyclophosphamide can reduce the risk of GVHD after SCT from a matched donor when it is added to or replaces the antimetabolite. However, the effects of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide specifically after SCT from a matched related donor remain uncertain, and effects in the context of myeloablative conditioning are unclear. We randomly assigned adults who were undergoing SCT from a matched related donor after myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning to receive either post-transplantation cyclophosphamide-cyclosporin (experimental prophylaxis) or cyclosporin-methotrexate (standard prophylaxis). The primary end point was GVHD-free, relapse-free survival. Among 134 patients who underwent randomization, 66 were assigned to receive experimental prophylaxis and 68 to receive standard prophylaxis. GVHD-free, relapse-free survival was significantly longer with experimental prophylaxis (median, 26.2 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.1 to not reached) than with standard prophylaxis (median, 6.4 months; 95% CI, 5.6 to 8.3; P<0.001 by a log-rank test). GVHD-free, relapse-free survival at 3 years was 49% (95% CI, 36 to 61) with experimental prophylaxis and 14% (95% CI, 6 to 25) with standard prophylaxis (hazard ratio for GVHD, relapse, or death, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66). The cumulative incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD at 3 months was 3% (95% CI, 1 to 10) in the experimental-prophylaxis group and 10% (95% CI, 4 to 19) in the standard-prophylaxis group. At 2 years, overall survival was 83% and 71%, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.19). The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the two groups in the first 100 days after SCT.

Children 6 months to 12 years of age with severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis and dehydration underwent randomization in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of three rehydration strategies: oral rehydration, plus intravenous boluses for shock; a rapid intravenous strategy that consisted of lactated Ringer's solution (100 ml per kilogram of body weight) administered over a period of 3 to 6 hours, with boluses for shock; or a slow intravenous strategy that consisted of the same solution administered over a period of 8 hours, with no boluses. The primary end point was death at 96 hours. A total of 272 children underwent randomization; 138 were assigned to the oral strategy, 67 to the rapid intravenous strategy, and 67 to the slow intravenous strategy. Participants were followed for 28 days. A nasogastric tube was used for oral rehydration in 126 of 135 participants (93%) in the oral group and in 82 of 126 (65%) in the intravenous groups.

Whether the use of proportional-assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) results in a shorter time to successful liberation from mechanical ventilation than pressure-support ventilation (PSV) is unclear. In this international clinical trial, we randomly assigned adult patients who had been receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours and were able to undergo partial ventilatory support with PSV but were not yet ready for liberation from ventilation to undergo PAV+ (which targeted normal work of breathing) or PSV (which targeted a normal respiratory rate and tidal volume). The primary outcome was the time from randomization to successful liberation from mechanical ventilation. Across 23 centers in seven countries, 722 patients were enrolled, and 573 underwent randomization and were included in the analysis. The median time to successful liberation from mechanical ventilation was 7.3 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2 to 9.7) in the PAV+ group and 6.8 days (95% CI, 5.4 to 8.8) in the PSV group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58). The median number of ventilator-free days, the incidence of reintubation and tracheostomy, and the incidence of death by day 90 (29.6% in the PAV+ group and 26.6% in the PSV group), all of which were secondary outcomes, were similar in the two groups. With respect to sedative drugs, the mean (&#xb1;SD) difference in the midazolam-equivalent dose at day 28 relative to the baseline dose was -1.51&#xb1;3.28 mg per kilogram of body weight in the PAV+ group and 0.04&#xb1;0.97 mg per kilogram in the PSV group.

In an open-label, two-period, two-sequence, cross-sectional, cluster-randomized, crossover trial, we assigned hospitals in Ontario, Canada, to use either lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline hospital-wide for a period of 12 weeks. After a washout period, hospitals switched to the other fluid for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a composite of death or readmission to the hospital within 90 days after the index admission. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome, as well as the length of stay in the hospital, initiation of dialysis within 90 days after the index admission, a visit to the emergency department within 90 days, and discharge to a facility other than home. Data on outcomes were obtained from health administrative databases. The analyses were conducted at the hospital level, and the primary estimand was the effect of the use of lactated Ringer's solution as compared with normal saline averaged across all participating hospitals. Seven hospitals completed both 12-week periods before the trial was interrupted owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Data on the primary outcome were available for 43,626 eligible patients. The mean (&#xb1;SD) incidence of the composite of death or readmission to the hospital within 90 days after the index admission was 20.3&#xb1;3.5% with lactated Ringer's solution and 21.4&#xb1;3.3% with normal saline (adjusted difference, -0.53 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.85 to 0.79; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.35).

Data on safety and durability from 13 years of follow-up in a cohort of patients who had been successfully treated with scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco gene therapy are now available. Ten men with severe hemophilia B received a single intravenous infusion of the scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco vector in one of three dose groups (low-dose: 2&#xd7;1011 vector genomes [vg] per kilogram of body weight [in two participants]; intermediate-dose: 6&#xd7;1011 vg per kilogram [in two]; or high-dose: 2&#xd7;1012 vg per kilogram [in six]). Efficacy outcomes included factor IX activity, the annualized bleeding rate, and factor IX concentrate use. Safety assessments included clinical events, liver function, and imaging. Participants were followed for a median of 13.0 years (range, 11.1 to 13.8). Factor IX activity remained stable across the dose cohorts, with mean factor IX levels of 1.7 IU per deciliter in the low-dose group, 2.3 IU per deciliter in the intermediate-dose group, and 4.8 IU per deciliter in the high-dose group. Seven of the 10 participants did not receive prophylaxis. The median annualized bleeding rate decreased from 14.0 episodes (interquartile range, 12.0 to 21.5) to 1.5 episodes (interquartile range, 0.7 to 2.2), which represented a reduction by a factor of 9.7. Use of factor IX concentrate decreased by a factor of 12.4 (interquartile range, 2.2 to 27.1). A total of 15 vector-related adverse events occurred, primarily transient elevations in aminotransferase levels. Factor IX inhibitor, thrombosis, or chronic liver injury did not develop in any participant. Two cancers were identified but were deemed by the investigators, together with an expert multidisciplinary team, as being unrelated to the vector. A liver biopsy that was conducted in 1 participant 10 years after the infusion revealed transcriptionally active transgene expression in hepatocytes without fibrosis or dysplasia. Levels of neutralizing antibodies to AAV8 remained high throughout follow-up, thus indicating potential barriers to readministration of the vector. A single administration of scAAV2/8-LP1-hFIXco gene therapy resulted in durable factor IX expression, sustained clinical benefit, and no late-onset safety concerns over a period of 13 years.

Most of the cases were cutaneous, although some respiratory cases as well as one death were reported. A pan-European consortium was created to assess the clinical, epidemiologic, and microbiologic features of this outbreak. We assessed cases of toxigenic C. diphtheriae infection that were reported in 10 European countries from January through November 2022. Data regarding countries of origin and transit routes were obtained from interviews with the patients. Whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial-susceptibility testing were performed on bacterial isolates that were obtained from the patients. The phylogenetic relationships of the isolates and their antimicrobial-resistance genes were evaluated. A total of 363 toxigenic C. diphtheriae isolates were identified among 362 patients during the study period. Clinical data were available for 346 patients (95.6%): 268 (77.5%) had cutaneous diphtheria, 53 (15.3%) had respiratory diphtheria (11 [3.2%] had a pseudomembrane), and 9 (2.6%) had both respiratory and cutaneous symptoms. Four major genetic clusters were identified, which indicated the multiclonal nature of the outbreak. The ermX gene (which codes for erythromycin resistance) and the pbp2m and blaOXA-2 genes (which code for beta-lactam resistance) were detected in a subgroup of isolates. Isolates that carried ermX were resistant to erythromycin, and isolates that carried pbp2m were resistant to penicillin but were susceptible to amoxicillin. On the basis of the genomic variation within the four genetic clusters, their most recent common ancestors were estimated to have existed between 2017 and 2020. The distribution of each genetic cluster of C. diphtheriae isolates across multiple countries in Europe showed repeated cross-border spread. The large number of C. diphtheriae infections among migrants is a cause for concern, particularly given that antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes threaten the efficacy of first-line treatments.

Camizestrant, a next-generation selective estrogen-receptor (ER) degrader and complete ER antagonist, has shown antitumor activity in ER-positive advanced breast cancer. We tested patients with advanced breast cancer with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumors for ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) once every 2 to 3 months. All the patients had received at least 6 months of first-line therapy with an aromatase inhibitor plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib). Patients who were found to have an ESR1 mutation and did not have radiologic progression were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to switch to camizestrant (75 mg once daily) with a continued CDK4/6 inhibitor plus placebo in place of an aromatase inhibitor or to continue to receive an aromatase inhibitor plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus placebo in place of camizestrant. The primary outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. A total of 3256 patients were tested for an ESR1 mutation. The 315 eligible patients were assigned to switch to camizestrant (157 patients) or to continue to receive an aromatase inhibitor (158 patients). At an interim analysis at a median follow-up of 12.6 months, the median progression-free survival was 16.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.7 to 18.2) in the camizestrant group and 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.2 to 9.5) in the aromatase-inhibitor group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.60; P<0.0001).

Data on albuterol-budesonide in mild asthma are needed. We conducted a fully virtual, decentralized, phase 3b, multicenter, double-blind, event-driven trial involving persons 12 years of age or older with disease that was uncontrolled despite treatment for mild asthma with a short-acting &#x3b2;2-agonist (SABA) with or without a low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid or leukotriene-receptor antagonist. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a fixed-dose combination of 180 &#x3bc;g of albuterol and 160 &#x3bc;g of budesonide (with each dose consisting of two inhaler actuations of 90 &#x3bc;g and 80 &#x3bc;g, respectively) or 180 &#x3bc;g of albuterol (with each dose consisting of two inhaler actuations of 90 &#x3bc;g) on an as-needed basis for up to 52 weeks. The primary end point was the first severe asthma exacerbation, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, in the on-treatment efficacy population, and the key secondary end point was the first severe exacerbation in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations and exposure to systemic glucocorticoids. A total of 2516 participants underwent randomization; 1797 (71.4%) completed the trial. Of 2421 participants in the full analysis population (1209 assigned to the albuterol-budesonide group and 1212 to the albuterol group), 97.2% were 18 years of age or older; 74.4% used a SABA alone at baseline. The trial was stopped for efficacy at a prespecified interim analysis. A severe exacerbation occurred in 5.1% of the participants in the albuterol-budesonide group and in 9.1% of those in the albuterol group in the on-treatment efficacy population (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.73) and in 5.3% and 9.4%, respectively, in the intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.73) (P<0.001 for both comparisons).

In this multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, noninferiority trial, we assigned patients with an intermediate-risk or high-risk peripheral pulmonary nodule measuring 10 to 30 mm in diameter to undergo navigational bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy at seven centers across the United States. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy, which was defined as the percentage of patients with biopsies that showed a specific diagnosis (cancer or a specific benign condition) that was confirmed to be accurate through 12 months of clinical follow-up (nonferiority margin, 10 percentage points). Secondary outcomes included procedural complications such as the occurrence of pneumothorax. Among the 234 patients included in the primary-outcome analysis (5 of whom were lost to follow-up), biopsy resulted in a specific diagnosis that was confirmed to be accurate through month 12 in 94 of 119 patients (79.0%) in the navigational bronchoscopy group and in 81 of 110 patients (73.6%) in the transthoracic needle biopsy group (absolute difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.5 to 17.2; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003 for noninferiority; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.17 for superiority).

The least-squares mean percent change in weight at week 72 was -20.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], -21.4 to -19.1) with tirzepatide and -13.7% (95% CI, -14.9 to -12.6) with semaglutide (P<0.001). The least-squares mean change in waist circumference was -18.4 cm (95% CI, -19.6 to -17.2) with tirzepatide and -13.0 cm (95% CI, -14.3 to -11.7) with semaglutide (P<0.001). Participants in the tirzepatide group were more likely than those in the semaglutide group to have weight reductions of at least 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%. The most common adverse events in both treatment groups were gastrointestinal, and most were mild to moderate in severity and occurred primarily during dose escalation. Among participants with obesity but without diabetes, treatment with tirzepatide was superior to treatment with semaglutide with respect to reduction in body weight and waist circumference at week 72.

We investigated the effect of the identified pathogenic variants using EPO promoter-driven luciferase reporter genes. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from patient cells and differentiated into hepatocyte-like EPO-producing cells. Samples of circulating EPO from patients with hereditary erythrocytosis and from healthy newborns were analyzed by means of isoelectric focusing, and EPO activity was assessed. Three novel variants were identified in the noncoding regions of EPO. Experiments with reporter assays and iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells showed that the variants targeted previously uncharacterized regulatory elements of the gene, which, when the variants were present, showed high responsiveness to hypoxia. EPO samples from all the patients showed a modified isoelectric-focusing profile, identical to hepatic EPO that is expressed in premature neonates and in patients with acquired erythrocytosis associated with liver diseases. EPO that was purified from patient plasma and umbilical-cord blood samples showed enhanced EPO receptor signaling activity in vitro, which suggests a potential gain of function linked to the liver-type glycosylation of EPO. We found that secondary erythrocytosis can be related to variants in EPO that lead to the production of hepatic-like EPO with an atypical glycosylation pattern and increased activity.

We evaluated zongertinib in a multicohort, phase 1a-1b trial involving patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC. Here we report the primary analysis of zongertinib in previously treated patients: those with tumors harboring a mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (cohort 1), those with tumors harboring a mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain previously treated with a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate (cohort 5), and those with tumors harboring a non-tyrosine kinase domain mutation (cohort 3). In cohort 1, patients were initially randomly assigned to receive zongertinib at a dose of 120 mg or 240 mg once daily. Patients in cohorts 5 and 3 initially received 240 mg daily. After an interim analysis of data from cohort 1, subsequently recruited patients across all cohorts received zongertinib at a dose of 120 mg. The primary end point was an objective response assessed by blinded independent central review (cohorts 1 and 5) or by investigator review (cohort 3).

The response to treatment was assessed in two cohorts: patients in cohort 1 had dMMR, locally advanced rectal cancer, and patients in cohort 2 had dMMR nonrectal solid tumors. Patients with a clinical complete response could elect to proceed with nonoperative management; those with residual disease were to undergo resection. In this analysis, the primary end point, assessed in cohort 1, was a sustained clinical complete response at 12 months. Recurrence-free survival and safety were evaluated. A total of 117 patients were included in the analysis. In cohort 1, all 49 patients who completed treatment had a clinical complete response and elected to proceed with nonoperative management. A total of 37 patients had a sustained clinical complete response at 12 months, a finding that met the criterion for efficacy. In cohort 2, a total of 35 of 54 patients who completed treatment had a clinical complete response, and 33 elected to proceed with nonoperative management.

We compared their outcomes with those of untreated patients (natural history cohort). The primary end point was survival free from severe motor impairment (the time from birth to the first occurrence of loss of locomotion and of sitting without support or death from any cause). A total of 39 treated patients and 49 untreated patients were included. The median follow-up was 6.76 years (range, 0.64 to 12.19).

The primary end point was the change in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 12, assessed as the least-squares mean difference from placebo (the placebo-adjusted change) in each lorundrostat group. A key secondary end point was the change in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 4, assessed as the placebo-adjusted change in the combined lorundrostat groups. A total of 285 participants underwent randomization; 94 were assigned to the stable-dose group, 96 to the dose-adjustment group, and 95 to the placebo group. The mean age was 60 years, and 150 participants (53%) were Black. After 12 weeks, the least-squares mean change in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure was -15.4 mm Hg in the stable-dose group, -13.9 mm Hg in the dose-adjustment group, and -7.4 mm Hg in the placebo group. The placebo-adjusted change in blood pressure was -7.9 mm Hg (97.5% confidence interval [CI], -13.3 to -2.6) in the stable-dose group and -6.5 mm Hg (97.5% CI, -11.8 to -1.2) in the dose-adjustment group. The placebo-adjusted change in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 4 in the combined lorundrostat groups was -5.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -8.4 to -2.3). A potassium level above 6.0 mmol per liter occurred in 5 participants (5%) in the stable-dose group, 7 participants (7%) in the dose-adjustment group, and no participants in the placebo group. Lorundrostat was associated with greater reductions in 24-hour average blood pressure than placebo in participants with uncontrolled and treatment-resistant hypertension.

The long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment are not known. In a 12-month study, 15 participants with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B (factor IX coagulant activity, &#x2264;2% of the normal value) received fidanacogene elaparvovec at a dose of 5&#xd7;1011 vector genomes (vg) per kilogram of body weight; thereafter, participants could enroll in a 5-year follow-up study. Safety end points included adverse events and changes in laboratory measures. Efficacy end points included the annualized rate of treated bleeding events (annualized bleeding rate) and factor IX activity. A total of 14 participants provided consent and completed at least 3 years of follow-up (median, 5.5; range 3 to 6); participation was ongoing among 8 at the data cutoff. None of the participants reported treatment-related adverse events after year 1. Throughout follow-up, nine serious adverse events were noted in 4 participants; none were thrombotic or treatment-related. No factor IX inhibitors were detected. Throughout follow-up, mean factor IX activity was in the mild hemophilia range; the mean annualized bleeding rate was less than 1, and 10 participants had no treated bleeding episodes. Surveillance liver ultrasounds obtained from year 1 onward showed no evidence of cancer but showed steatosis in 4 participants who had weight gain and elevated aminotransferase levels (maximum alanine aminotransferase level, 77 U per liter). One participant with a history of hepatitis C, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and an elevated body-mass index had progression of underlying advanced liver fibrosis. A total of 13 surgical procedures were performed in 8 participants; exogenous factor IX was administered for 10 procedures, and no associated unexpected bleeding complications occurred.

Evidence from randomized, controlled trials of safety and efficacy in patients with mpox is lacking. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of tecovirimat in patients with mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Patients with at least one mpox skin lesion and positive polymerase-chain-reaction results for clade I MPXV were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive tecovirimat or placebo. All patients received supportive care. The primary end point was resolution of mpox lesions, measured in number of days after randomization. Safety was also assessed. From October 7, 2022, through July 9, 2024, a total of 597 patients underwent randomization - 295 to receive tecovirimat and 302 to receive placebo. The median time from randomization to lesion resolution was 7 days with tecovirimat and 8 days with placebo; the competing-risks hazard ratio for lesion resolution was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.31; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.14).

We recruited persons 55 to 69 years of age from primary care centers in the United Kingdom. Using germline DNA extracted from saliva, we derived polygenic risk scores from 130 variants known to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Participants with a polygenic risk score in the 90th percentile or higher were invited to undergo prostate cancer screening with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transperineal biopsy, irrespective of PSA level. Among 40,292 persons invited to participate, 8953 (22.2%) expressed interest in participating and 6393 had their polygenic risk score calculated; 745 (11.7%) had a polygenic risk score in the 90th percentile or higher and were invited to undergo screening. Of these 745 participants, 468 (62.8%) underwent MRI and prostate biopsy; prostate cancer was detected in 187 participants (40.0%). The median age at diagnosis was 64 years (range, 57 to 73). Of the 187 participants with cancer, 103 (55.1%) had prostate cancer classified as intermediate or higher risk according to the 2024 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria, so treatment was indicated; cancer would not have been detected in 74 (71.8%) of these participants according to the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway currently used in the United Kingdom (high PSA level and positive MRI results). In addition, 40 of the participants with cancer (21.4%) had disease classified as unfavorable intermediate risk or as high or very high risk according to NCCN criteria.

We conducted this randomized, controlled trial in Spain to evaluate the efficacy of dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) as compared with standard care alone in patients with aortic stenosis who were undergoing TAVI. All the patients had a history of heart failure plus at least one of the following: renal insufficiency, diabetes, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause or worsening of heart failure, defined as hospitalization or an urgent visit, at 1 year of follow-up. A total of 620 patients were randomly assigned to receive dapagliflozin and 637 to receive standard care alone after TAVI; after exclusions, a total of 1222 patients were included in the primary analysis. A primary-outcome event occurred in 91 patients (15.0%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 124 patients (20.1%) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.95; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02).

Worsening of heart failure occurred in 9.4% and 14.4% of the patients, respectively (subhazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88). Genital infection and hypotension were significantly more common in the dapagliflozin group. Among older adults with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI who were at high risk for heart-failure events, dapagliflozin resulted in a significantly lower incidence of death from any cause or worsening of heart failure than standard care alone.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial with blinded central outcome adjudication. Consecutive patients with active cancer and proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who had completed at least 6 months of anticoagulant therapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral apixaban at a reduced (2.5 mg) or full (5.0 mg) dose twice daily for 12 months. The primary outcome was centrally adjudicated fatal or nonfatal recurrent venous thromboembolism, assessed in a noninferiority analysis (margin of 2.00 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the subhazard ratio). The key secondary outcome was clinically relevant bleeding, assessed in a superiority analysis. A total of 1766 patients underwent randomization at a median time since the index event of 8.0 months (interquartile range, 6.5 to 12.6); 866 patients were assigned to the reduced-dose group, and 900 to the full-dose group. The median treatment duration was 11.8 months (interquartile range, 8.3 to 12.1). Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 18 patients (cumulative incidence, 2.1%) in the reduced-dose group and in 24 (cumulative incidence, 2.8%) in the full-dose group (adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 1.41; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 for noninferiority).

We randomly assigned adults with physician-diagnosed, symptomatic, severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps to receive standard care and either tezepelumab (at a dose of 210 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The coprimary end points were the changes from baseline in the total nasal-polyp score (range, 0 to 4 [for each nostril]; higher scores indicate greater severity) and the mean nasal-congestion score (range, 0 to 3; higher scores indicate greater severity) at week 52. Key secondary end points assessed in the overall population were the loss-of-smell score, the total score on the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22; range, 0 to 110; higher scores indicate greater severity), the Lund-Mackay score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), the total symptom score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), and the first decision to treat with nasal-polyp surgery or use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, or both, assessed in time-to-event analyses (individual and composite). In total, 203 patients were assigned to receive tezepelumab and 205 to receive placebo. At week 52, the patients who received tezepelumab had significant improvements in the total nasal-polyp score (mean difference vs. placebo, -2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.39 to -1.74) and the mean nasal-congestion score (-1.03; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.86) (P<0.001 for both scores). Tezepelumab significantly improved the loss-of-smell score (mean difference vs. placebo, -1.00; 95% CI, -1.18 to -0.83), SNOT-22 total score (-27.26; 95% CI, -32.32 to -22.21), Lund-Mackay score (-5.72; 95% CI, -6.39 to -5.06), and total symptom score (-6.89; 95% CI, -8.02 to -5.76) (P<0.001 for all&#xa0;scores). Surgery for nasal polyps was indicated in significantly fewer patients in the tezepelumab group (0.5%) than in the placebo group (22.1%) (hazard ratio, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.09); there was significantly less use of systemic glucocorticoids with tezepelumab (5.2%) than with placebo (18.3%) (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27) (P<0.001 for both time-to-event analyses). Tezepelumab therapy led to significantly greater reductions in the size of nasal polyps, the severity of nasal congestion and sinonasal symptoms, and the use of nasal-polyp surgery and systemic glucocorticoids than placebo in adults with severe, uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

We conducted a population-based cohort study to assess epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of scrub typhus in 37 villages in Tamil Nadu, India, where the disease is highly endemic. Study participants were visited every 6 to 8 weeks over a period of 2 years; a venous blood sample was obtained from those who had had fever since the last visit. A subcohort of participants underwent blood sampling to estimate the incidence of serologically confirmed Orientia tsutsugamushi infection. We systematically assessed 32,279 participants from 7619 households for acute febrile illness. During 54,588 person-years of follow-up, we observed 6175 episodes of fever. A blood sample was obtained in 4474 episodes (72.5%), of which 328 (7.3%) met the clinical case definition of scrub typhus (detection of IgM against O. tsutsugamushi on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] or detection of O. tsutsugamushi on polymerase-chain-reaction assay). The incidence of clinical infection was 6.0 cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8 to 7.5). A total of 71 clinical cases (21.6%) resulted in hospitalization (incidence, 1.3 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.7). A total of 29 clinical cases (8.8%) were severe, as indicated by the presence of organ dysfunction or adverse pregnancy outcomes (incidence, 0.5 cases per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.8). Among 2128 participants in the subcohort who provided samples at the beginning and end of a study year, the incidence of seroconversion independent of any symptoms was 81.2 events per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 70.8 to 91.6). The incidence of clinical infection was higher in older age groups than in younger age groups and higher among female participants than among male participants. By contrast, the age-adjusted rate of severe infection was similar among male and female participants. Among 5602 participants assessed at the start of the first year of the study, the seroprevalence of IgG as assessed with ELISA was 42.8% (95% CI, 35.8 to 50.2). IgG seropositivity at the beginning of years 1 or 2 did not protect against clinical illness during the subsequent year but was associated with less severe disease than IgG seronegativity.

Key secondary end points included adverse events and a UAS7 of 6 or lower at weeks 2 and 12 and a UAS7 of 0 at week 12. A total of 470 patients in REMIX-1 and 455 in REMIX-2 were randomly assigned to receive either remibrutinib (313 and 300 patients, respectively) or placebo (157 and 155 patients, respectively). The remibrutinib group had a significantly greater decrease in the UAS7 at week 12 than the placebo group (least-squares mean [&#xb1;SE] change, -20.0&#xb1;0.7 vs. -13.8&#xb1;1.0 [P<0.001] in REMIX-1 and -19.4&#xb1;0.7 vs. -11.7&#xb1;0.9 [P<0.001] in REMIX-2), which appeared to be sustained through week 24. At week 12, significantly more patients in the remibrutinib group than in the placebo group had a UAS7 of 6 or lower (REMIX-1, 49.8% vs. 24.8% [P<0.001]; REMIX-2, 46.8% vs. 19.6% [P<0.001]) and a UAS7 of 0 (REMIX-1, 31.1% vs. 10.5% [P<0.001]; REMIX-2, 27.9% vs. 6.5% [P<0.001]). The percentages of patients with any adverse event and with serious adverse events were similar in the remibrutinib group and the placebo group, although a higher percentage of patients in the remibrutinib group than in the placebo group had petechiae (3.8% vs. 0.3% in the combined groups). Treatment with oral remibrutinib resulted in a significant improvement in a composite measure of itching and hives at week 12.

Evidence of sexual exchange of bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms between partners suggests that male-partner treatment may increase the likelihood of cure. This open-label, randomized, controlled trial involved couples in which a woman had bacterial vaginosis and was in a monogamous relationship with a male partner. In the partner-treatment group, the woman received first-line recommended antimicrobial agents and the male partner received oral and topical antimicrobial treatment (metronidazole 400-mg tablets and 2% clindamycin cream applied to penile skin, both twice daily for 7 days). In the control group, the woman received first-line treatment and the male partner received no treatment (standard care). The primary outcome was recurrence of bacterial vaginosis within 12 weeks. A total of 81 couples were assigned to the partner-treatment group, and 83 couples were assigned to the control group. The trial was stopped by the data and safety monitoring board after 150 couples had completed the 12-week follow-up period because treatment of the woman only was inferior to treatment of both the woman and her male partner. In the modified intention-to-treat population, recurrence occurred in 24 of 69 women (35%) in the partner-treatment group (recurrence rate, 1.6 per person-year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 2.4) and in 43 of 68 women (63%) in the control group (recurrence rate, 4.2 per person-year; 95% CI, 3.2 to 5.7), which corresponded to an absolute risk difference of -2.6 recurrences per person-year (95% CI, -4.0 to -1.2; P<0.001). Adverse events in treated men included nausea, headache, and metallic taste. The addition of combined oral and topical antimicrobial therapy for male partners to treatment of women for bacterial vaginosis resulted in a lower rate of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis within 12 weeks than standard care.

The Safer Births Bundle of Care program is a combination of interventions developed to improve the quality of care for mother and baby with the goal of reducing birth-related mortality. We performed a 3-year stepped-wedge cluster-randomized study of the Safer Births program at 30 high-burden facilities in five regions in Tanzania. The bundle of interventions in the program was aimed at continuous quality improvement through regular onsite simulation-based training, the collection and use of local clinical data, the assistance of trained local facilitators, and the use of innovative tools for perinatal care. The primary outcome was perinatal death, which included intrapartum stillbirth (suspected death during labor) and neonatal death within the first 24 hours after birth. A total of 281,165 mothers and 277,734 babies were included in the final analysis. The estimated incidence of perinatal death decreased from 15.3 deaths per 1000 births in the baseline period of the program to 12.5 deaths per 1000 births after implementation (adjusted relative risk, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.92; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), with substantial heterogeneity among regions. The incidence of intrapartum stillbirths was 8.6 deaths per 1000 births in the baseline period and 8.7 deaths per 1000 births after implementation (adjusted relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.17), and the incidence of neonatal deaths within the first 24 hours after birth was 6.4 and 3.9 deaths per 1000 births, respectively (adjusted relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.77). No serious adverse events were reported. Implementation of the Safer Births Bundle of Care program showed the feasibility of integrating quality-improvement efforts targeting birth-related emergencies in resource-limited settings and was associated with a significant reduction in perinatal mortality.

In this phase 3, open-label trial, we included patients 18 years of age or older who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 to 2 (range, 0 to 5, with higher numbers indicating greater disability) and who did not have a 17p deletion or TP53 mutation. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive acalabrutinib-venetoclax (acalabrutinib, cycles 1 to 14; venetoclax, cycles 3 to 14), acalabrutinib-venetoclax-obinutuzumab (as above, plus obinutuzumab, cycles 2 to 7), or chemoimmunotherapy with the investigator's choice of fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab or bendamustine-rituximab (cycles 1 to 6). The primary end point was progression-free survival (acalabrutinib-venetoclax vs. chemoimmunotherapy) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed by blinded independent central review. A total of 867 patients underwent randomization: 291 were assigned to receive acalabrutinib-venetoclax, 286 acalabrutinib-venetoclax-obinutuzumab, and 290 chemoimmunotherapy (of whom 143 received fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab and 147 bendamustine-rituximab). The median age of the patients was 61 years (range, 26 to 86), 64.5% were men, and 58.6% had unmutated IGHV. Estimated 36-month progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 40.8 months was 76.5% with acalabrutinib-venetoclax, 83.1% with acalabrutinib-venetoclax-obinutuzumab, and 66.5% with chemoimmunotherapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with acalabrutinib-venetoclax vs. chemoimmunotherapy, 0.65 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.49 to 0.87], P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004; for the comparison of acalabrutinib-venetoclax-obinutuzumab with chemoimmunotherapy, P<0.001).

The minimum dose requirements for seroconversion remain unknown. In this double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial in Uganda and Kenya, we assigned adults with no history of yellow fever vaccination or infection to receive vaccination with the Institut Pasteur de Dakar 17D-204 yellow fever vaccine at a standard dose (13,803 IU) or at a fractional dose of 1000 IU, 500 IU, or 250 IU. The primary outcome was seroconversion at 28 days after vaccination with each fractional dose as compared with the standard dose, evaluated in a noninferiority analysis. Seroconversion was defined as an antibody titer at day 28 that was at least four times as high as the antibody titer before vaccination, as measured by a plaque reduction neutralization test. We conducted noninferiority analyses in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations. Noninferiority was shown if the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the incidence of seroconversion between the fractional dose and the standard dose was higher than -10 percentage points. A total of 480 participants underwent randomization (120 participants in each group). The incidence of seroconversion was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94 to 100) with the standard dose. The difference in the incidence of seroconversion between the 1000-IU dose and the standard dose was 0.01 percentage points (95% CI, -5.0 to 5.1) in the intention-to-treat population and -1.9 percentage points (95% CI, -7.0 to 3.2) in the per-protocol population; the corresponding differences between the 500-IU dose and the standard dose were 0.01 percentage points (95% CI, -5.0 to 5.1) and -1.8 percentage points (95% CI, -6.7 to 3.2), and those between the 250-IU dose and the standard dose were -4.4 percentage points (95% CI, -9.4 to 0.7) and -6.7 percentage points (95% CI, -11.7 to 1.6). A total of 111 vaccine-related adverse events were reported: 103 were mild in severity, 7 were moderate, and 1 was severe. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the four groups.

The advent of new drugs to treat tuberculosis and enhanced funding now permit randomized, controlled trials of shortened-duration, all-oral treatments for rifampin-resistant tuberculosis. We conducted a phase 3, multinational, open-label, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial to compare standard therapy for treatment of fluoroquinolone-susceptible, rifampin-resistant tuberculosis with five 9-month oral regimens that included various combinations of bedaquiline (B), delamanid (D), linezolid (L), levofloxacin (Lfx) or moxifloxacin (M), clofazimine (C), and pyrazinamide (Z). Participants were randomly assigned (with the use of Bayesian response-adaptive randomization) to receive one of five combinations or standard therapy. The primary end point was a favorable outcome at week 73, defined by two negative sputum culture results or favorable bacteriologic, clinical, and radiologic evolution. The noninferiority margin was -12 percentage points. Among the 754 participants who underwent randomization, 699 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, and 562 in the per-protocol analysis. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 80.7% of the patients in the standard-therapy group had favorable outcomes. The risk difference between standard therapy and each of the four new regimens that were found to be noninferior in the modified intention-to-treat population was as follows: BCLLfxZ, 9.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 18.7); BLMZ, 8.3 percentage points (95% CI, -0.8 to 17.4); BDLLfxZ, 4.6 percentage points (95% CI, -4.9 to 14.1); and DCMZ, 2.5 percentage points (95% CI, -7.5 to 12.5). Differences were similar in the per-protocol population, with the exception of DCMZ, which was not noninferior in that population. The proportion of participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events was similar across the regimens. Grade 3 or higher hepatotoxic events occurred in 11.7% of participants overall and in 7.1% of those receiving standard therapy. Consistent results across all the analyses support the noninferior efficacy of three all-oral shortened regimens for the treatment of rifampin-resistant tuberculosis.

Patients with atrial fibrillation and a moderate-to-high risk of stroke were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous injection of abelacimab (150 mg or 90 mg once monthly) administered in a blinded fashion or oral rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) administered in an open-label fashion. The primary end point was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. A total of 1287 patients underwent randomization; the median age was 74 years, and 44% were women. At 3 months, the median reduction in free factor XI levels with abelacimab at a dose of 150 mg was 99% (interquartile range, 98 to 99) and with abelacimab at a dose of 90 mg was 97% (interquartile range, 51 to 99). The trial was stopped early on the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee because of a greater-than-anticipated reduction in bleeding events with abelacimab. The incidence rate of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was 3.2 events per 100 person-years&#xa0;with 150-mg abelacimab and 2.6 events per 100 person-years with 90-mg abelacimab, as compared with 8.4 events per 100 person-years with rivaroxaban (hazard ratio for 150-mg abelacimab vs. rivaroxaban, 0.38 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.24 to 0.60]; hazard ratio for 90-mg abelacimab vs. rivaroxaban, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.51]; P<0.001 for both comparisons). The incidence and severity of adverse events appeared to be similar in the three groups.

An important question is whether perioperative chemotherapy is preferable to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. In this phase 3, multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned in a 1:1 ratio patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma to receive perioperative chemotherapy with FLOT (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) plus surgery or preoperative chemoradiotherapy (radiotherapy at a dose of 41.4 Gy and carboplatin and paclitaxel) plus surgery. Eligibility criteria included a primary tumor with a clinical stage of cT1 cN+, cT2-4a cN+, or cT2-4a cN0 disease, in which T indicates the size and extent of the tumor (higher numbers indicate a more advanced tumor), and N indicates the presence (N+) or absence (N0) of cancer spread to the lymph nodes, without evidence of metastatic spread. The primary end point was overall survival. From February 2016 through April 2020, we assigned 221 patients to the FLOT group and 217 patients to the preoperative-chemoradiotherapy group. With a median follow-up of 55 months, overall survival at 3 years was 57.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.1 to 64.0) in the FLOT group and 50.7% (95% CI, 43.5 to 57.5) in the preoperative-chemoradiotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Progression-free survival at 3 years was 51.6% (95% CI, 44.3 to 58.4) in the FLOT group and 35.0% (95% CI, 28.4 to 41.7) in the preoperative-chemoradiotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.85).

The primary analysis of KATHERINE, a phase 3, open-label trial, showed that the risk of invasive breast cancer or death was 50% lower with adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) than with trastuzumab alone. We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer with residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla after neoadjuvant systemic treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy and trastuzumab to receive T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14 cycles. Here, we report the prespecified final analysis of invasive disease-free survival and the second interim analysis of overall survival. With a median follow-up of 8.4 years, T-DM1 sustained the improvement in invasive disease-free survival over trastuzumab (unstratified hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.66). Seven-year invasive disease-free survival was 80.8% with T-DM1 and 67.1% with trastuzumab (difference, 13.7 percentage points).

Adults and children who were referred for PICC placement were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a hydrophobic or chlorhexidine PICC or a standard polyurethane PICC and were followed for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was device failure, which was a composite of infectious (bloodstream or local) or noninfectious (thrombosis, breakage, or occlusion) complications. A total of 1098 participants underwent randomization; 365 were assigned to the hydrophobic group, 365 to the chlorhexidine group, and 368 to the standard-polyurethane group.

Driver mutations are the pathophysiological hallmark of the disease, but the role of mutation clearance after transplantation is unclear. We used highly sensitive polymerase-chain-reaction technology to analyze the dynamics of driver mutations in peripheral-blood samples from 324 patients with myelofibrosis (73% with JAK2 mutations, 23% with CALR mutations, and 4% with MPL mutations) who were undergoing transplantation after reduced-intensity conditioning. Mutations were detected before transplantation and at 30, 100, and 180 days after transplantation to measure clearance and its effect on relapse and cure. The two primary end points were relapse and disease-free survival. At day 30 after transplantation, mutation clearance was found in 42% of the patients who had JAK2 mutations, 73% of those who had CALR mutations, and 54% of those who had MPL mutations; the corresponding percentages at day 100 were 63%, 82%, and 100%. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year was 6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2 to 10) among patients with mutation clearance at day 30 after transplantation and 21% (95% CI, 15 to 27) among those without mutation clearance at day 30. Disease-free and overall survival at 6 years were 61% and 74%, respectively, among patients with mutation clearance at day 30 after transplantation and 41% and 60%, respectively, among those without mutation clearance at day 30. Mutation clearance at day 30 appeared to outperform traditional donor chimerism as a measure of response; it was independently associated with a reduced risk of relapse or progression (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.61) and appeared to overcome differences in prognosis based on the type of driver mutation (JAK2 vs. MPL or CALR).

We conducted a phase 1b-2 study of talquetamab plus teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In phase 1, we investigated five dose levels in a dose-escalation study. Talquetamab at a dose of 0.8 mg per kilogram of body weight plus teclistamab at a dose of 3.0 mg per kilogram every other week was selected as the recommended phase 2 regimen. The primary objective was to evaluate adverse events and dose-limiting toxic effects. A total of 94 patients received treatment, with the recommended phase 2 regimen used in 44. The median follow-up was 20.3 months. Three patients had dose-limiting toxic effects (including grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 patient with the recommended phase 2 regimen). Across all dose levels, the most common adverse events were cytokine release syndrome, neutropenia, taste changes, and nonrash skin events. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, most commonly hematologic events, occurred in 96% of the patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 64% of the patients. With the recommended phase 2 regimen, a response occurred in 80% of the patients (including in 61% of those with extramedullary disease); across all dose levels, a response occurred in 78%.

Additional data are needed to identify DNA-sequencing patterns and other biomarkers that can identify pregnant persons who are most likely to have cancer and to determine the best approach for follow-up. In this ongoing study we performed cancer screening in pregnant or postpartum persons who did not perceive signs or symptoms of cancer but received unusual clinical cfDNA-sequencing results or results that were nonreportable (i.e., the fetal aneuploidy status could not be assessed) from one of 12 different commercial laboratories in North America. We used a uniform cancer-screening protocol including rapid whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), laboratory tests, and standardized cfDNA sequencing for research purposes with the use of a genomewide platform. The primary outcome was the presence of cancer in participants after the initial cancer-screening evaluation. Secondary analyses included test performance. Cancer was present in 52 of the 107 participants in the initial cohort (48.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of whole-body MRI in detecting occult cancer were 98.0% and 88.5%, respectively. Physical examination and laboratory tests were of limited use in identifying participants with cancer. Research sequencing showed that 49 participants had a combination of copy-number gains and losses across multiple (&#x2265;3) chromosomes; cancer was present in 47 of the participants (95.9%) with this sequencing pattern. Sequencing patterns of cfDNA in which there were only chromosomal gains (multiple trisomies) or only chromosomal losses (one or more monosomies) were found in participants with nonmalignant conditions, such as fibroids. In this study, 48.6% of participants who received unusual or nonreportable clinical cfDNA-sequencing results had an occult cancer.

However, cluster-randomized evidence from Guinea in 2015 had indicated that ring vaccination around new cases (targeting contacts and contacts-of-contacts) with the use of single-dose live-replicating rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine reduced EVD rates starting 10 days after vaccination. Thus, ring vaccination was added to the standard control measures for that outbreak. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of EVD within the first 9 days after vaccination (when little protection was expected from case isolation or ring vaccination), during days 10 to 29, and at later time periods. We established 1853 rings around new cases or clusters within 21 days after symptom onset in the index case and offered vaccination to the ring members. Vaccinees were monitored for EVD onset until the end of the outbreak in mid-2020. From August 8, 2018, to January 14, 2020, we vaccinated 265,183 participants. Of these vaccinees, 102,515 were monitored on days 0, 3, and 21 for safety. Among the contacts and contacts-of-contacts, 434 cases of EVD (0.2 per ring) were diagnosed, almost all within 0 to 9 days (380 cases) or 10 to 29 days (32 cases) after vaccination. An additional 22 cases were diagnosed after day 29 during an average of 170 more days of follow-up. The sooner that control measures (including ring vaccination) began after EVD onset in the index case, the sooner EVD rates fell among contacts. In each subgroup, EVD rates fell suddenly around day 10. Among the contacts and contacts-of-contacts who were still disease-free at day 10, the EVD onset rate during days 10 to 29 was 0.16 per 1000 (in 32 of 194,019 participants). This rate was much lower than the rate of 4.64 per 1000 (in 21 of 4528 participants) that had been seen among similarly defined ring members in Guinea, in whom standard control measures had been promptly initiated but vaccination was delayed until 21 days after ring formation (rate ratio, 0.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.06). No safety concerns with the vaccine were identified.

Evidence from randomized, controlled trials on tuberculosis preventive treatment in persons exposed to MDR tuberculosis is lacking. In this community-based, multisite, double-blind, cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, we assessed the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin as preventive treatment in children with household exposure to an adult with bacteriologically confirmed MDR pulmonary tuberculosis. Children younger than 5 years of age were eligible for inclusion regardless of interferon-&#x3b3; release assay result or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, and children 5 to 17 years of age were eligible if they had a positive interferon-&#x3b3; release assay or HIV infection. Households were randomly assigned to a trial regimen, and children in the household received levofloxacin or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was incident tuberculosis, which included death from tuberculosis, by week 48 after randomization. The primary safety end point was any adverse event of grade 3 or higher during the treatment period that was at least possibly related to the trial regimen.

After completing the 8-week course of bedaquiline, the patients started standard multidrug therapy (as defined by the World Health Organization) for leprosy and were followed for 112 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the odds of positive growth of Mycobacterium leprae in mouse footpads after 8 weeks of bedaquiline therapy. The secondary end point was safety. Exploratory end points included change in the clinical signs and symptoms of leprosy and in the molecular viability of M. leprae (measured by a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay). A total of nine patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The odds of positive M. leprae growth had decreased from 100% in all the patients at baseline to no growth after 4 weeks of bedaquiline monotherapy.

Seven patients had at least one adverse event (all grade 1 or 2) during treatment.

We report here the per-protocol analysis of invasive disease-free survival (the primary efficacy outcome). To show the noninferiority of the omission of axillary surgery, the 5-year invasive disease-free survival rate had to be at least 85%, and the upper limit of the confidence interval for the hazard ratio for invasive disease or death had to be below 1.271. A total of 5502 eligible patients (90% with clinical T1 cancer and 79% with pathological T1 cancer) underwent randomization in a 1:4 ratio. The per-protocol population included 4858 patients; 962 were assigned to undergo treatment without axillary surgery (the surgery-omission group), and 3896 to undergo sentinel-lymph-node biopsy (the surgery group). The median follow-up was 73.6 months.

The safety analysis indicates that patients in the surgery-omission group had a lower incidence of lymphedema, greater arm mobility, and less pain with movement of the arm or shoulder than patients who underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy. In this trial involving patients with clinically node-negative, T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer (90% with clinical T1 cancer and 79% with pathological T1 cancer), omission of surgical axillary staging was noninferior to sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after a median follow-up of 6 years.

The estimated 3-year disease-free survival among patients with an average relapse risk was 97.5&#xb1;1.3% with blinatumomab and chemotherapy and 90.2&#xb1;2.3% with chemotherapy alone; among those with a higher relapse risk, the corresponding values were 94.1&#xb1;2.5% and 84.8&#xb1;3.8%. Cytokine release syndrome, seizures, and sepsis of grade 3 or higher were rare during blinatumomab cycles, but the overall incidence of nonfatal sepsis and catheter-related infections was significantly higher among patients with an average relapse risk who had been assigned to receive blinatumomab and chemotherapy than among those assigned to receive chemotherapy alone. Adding blinatumomab to combination chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed childhood standard-risk B-cell ALL of average or higher risk of relapse significantly improved disease-free survival.

We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study of obe-cel in adults (&#x2265;18 years of age) with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The main cohort, cohort 2A, included patients with morphologic disease; patients in cohort 2B had measurable residual disease. The primary end point was overall remission (complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) in cohort 2A. Secondary end points included event-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Of the 153 enrolled patients, 127 (83.0%) received at least one infusion of obe-cel and were evaluable. In cohort 2A (94 patients; median follow-up, 20.3 months), overall remission occurred in 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 85), with complete remission in 55% (95% CI, 45 to 66) and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery in 21% (95% CI, 14 to 31). The prespecified null hypotheses of overall remission (&#x2264;40%) and complete remission (&#x2264;20%) were rejected (P<0.001). In the 127 patients who received at least one obe-cel infusion (median follow-up, 21.5 months), the median event-free survival was 11.9 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 22.1); estimated 6- and 12-month event-free survival was 65.4% and 49.5%, respectively.

Nivolumab plus ipilimumab has shown clinical benefit in nonrandomized studies of MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer. In this phase 3 open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer and MSI-H or dMMR status according to local testing to receive, in a 2:2:1 ratio, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab alone, or chemotherapy with or without targeted therapies. The dual primary end points, assessed in patients with centrally confirmed MSI-H or dMMR status, were progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab as compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy and progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab as compared with nivolumab alone in patients regardless of previous systemic treatment for metastatic disease. At this prespecified interim analysis, the first primary end point (involving nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. chemotherapy) was assessed. A total of 303 patients who had not previously received systemic treatment for metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab or chemotherapy; 255 patients had centrally confirmed MSI-H or dMMR tumors. At a median follow-up of 31.5 months (range, 6.1 to 48.4), progression-free survival outcomes (the primary analysis) were significantly better with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy (P<0.001 for the between-group difference in progression-free survival, calculated with the use of a two-sided stratified log-rank test); 24-month progression-free survival was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64 to 79) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab as compared with 14% (95% CI, 6 to 25) with chemotherapy.

We investigated whether a single primary dose and booster dose (1p+1) of the 10-valent PCV (PCV10) would be noninferior to alternative dose schedules in sustaining control of carriage of pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. In Nha Trang, Vietnam, an area in which PCV had not been used previously, a PCV10 catch-up campaign was conducted in which the vaccine was offered to children younger than 3 years of age, after which a cluster-randomized trial was conducted in which children received PCV10 at 2, 3, and 4 months of age (3p+0 group); at 2, 4, and 12 months of age (2p+1 group); at 2 and 12 months of age (1p+1 group); or at 12 months of age (0p+1 group). Annual carriage surveys in infants (4 to 11 months of age) and toddlers (14 to 24 months of age) were conducted from 2016 through 2020. The primary end point was protection against carriage of vaccine serotypes, evaluated in a noninferiority analysis in the 1p+1 group as compared with the 2p+1 and 3p+0 groups, 3.5 years after vaccine introduction (noninferiority margin, 5 percentage points). Noninferiority of the 0p+1 schedule was also evaluated. In 2016, before the introduction of PCV10, vaccine-serotype carriage was found in 160 of 1363 infants (11.7%); in 2020, vaccine-serotype carriage was found in 6 of 333 (1.8%), 5 of 340 (1.5%), and 4 of 313 (1.3%) infants in the 1p+1, 2p+1, and 3p+0 groups, respectively, indicating noninferiority of 1p+1 to 2p+1 (difference, 0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.6 to 2.2) and to 3p+0 (difference, 0.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.4 to 2.4). Similarly, 1p+1 was noninferior to 2p+1 and 3p+0 for protection against vaccine-serotype carriage among toddlers. In 2016, carriage of serotype 6A was found in 99 of 1363 infants (7.3%); in 2020, it was found in 12 of 333 (3.6%), 10 of 340 (2.9%), and 3 of 313 (1.0%) infants in the 1p+1, 2p+1, and 3p+0 groups, respectively. The 0p+1 schedule was also noninferior to the other three dose schedules among infants and toddlers, although cross-protection against serotype 6A was less common than with the other vaccination schedules. No PCV10-associated severe adverse effects were observed. A reduced vaccination schedule involving a single primary dose and booster dose of PCV10 was noninferior to alternative schedules in protecting against vaccine-serotype carriage in infants and toddlers.

Immunization with live-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites is an alternative vaccination strategy that has potential to improve protection. We conducted a double-blind, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety, side-effect profile, and efficacy of immunization, by means of mosquito bites, with a second-generation genetically attenuated parasite (GA2) - a mei2 single knockout P. falciparum NF54 parasite (sporozoite form) with extended development into the liver stage. After an open-label dose-escalation safety phase in which participants were exposed to the bites of 15 or 50 infected mosquitoes (stage A), healthy adults who had not had malaria were randomly assigned to be exposed to 50 mosquito bites per immunization of GA2, an early-arresting parasite (GA1), or placebo (bites from uninfected mosquitoes) (stage B). After the completion of three immunization sessions with 50 mosquito bites per session, we compared the protective efficacy of GA2 against homologous P. falciparum controlled human malaria infection with that of GA1 and placebo. The primary end points were the number and severity of adverse events (in stages A and B) and blood-stage parasitemia greater than 100 P. falciparum parasites per milliliter after bites from GA2-infected mosquitoes (in stage A) and after controlled human malaria infection (in stage B). Adverse events were similar across the trial groups. Protective efficacy against subsequent controlled human malaria infection was observed in 8 of 9 participants (89%) in the GA2 group, in 1 of 8 participants (13%) in the GA1 group, and in 0 of 3 participants in the placebo group. A significantly higher frequency of P. falciparum-specific polyfunctional CD4+ and V&#x3b4;2+ &#x3b3;&#x3b4; T cells were observed among participants who received GA2 than among those who received GA1, whereas GA2 and GA1 induced similar antibody titers targeting the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein. In this small trial, GA2 was associated with a favorable immune induction profile and protective efficacy, findings that warrant further evaluation.

In this phase 2 dose-finding study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral infigratinib in children with achondroplasia between the ages of 3 and 11 years. A total of 72 children were enrolled in five sequential cohorts to receive daily infigratinib at doses of 0.016 mg per kilogram of body weight (cohort 1), 0.032 mg per kilogram (cohort 2), 0.064 mg per kilogram (cohort 3), 0.128 mg per kilogram (cohort 4), and 0.25 mg per kilogram (cohort 5) for 6 months, followed by 12 months of extended treatment in which the dose in cohorts 1 and 2 could be escalated to the next ascending level at months 6 and 12. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of adverse events that led to a decrease in the dose or discontinuation of infigratinib. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline in the annualized height velocity. During treatment, all the children had at least one adverse event, most of which were mild or moderate in severity; none resulted in treatment discontinuation. In cohort 5, an increased annualized height velocity was observed, which persisted throughout the duration of the study, with a mean change from baseline at 18 months of 2.50 cm per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22 to 3.79; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001).

Inebilizumab targets and depletes CD19+ B cells and may be effective for treating patients with IgG4-related disease. In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, adults with active IgG4-related disease underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive inebilizumab (300-mg intravenous infusions on days 1 and 15 and week 26) or placebo for a 52-week treatment period. Participants in both groups received identical glucocorticoid tapers. Glucocorticoids were allowed to treat disease flares, but background immunosuppressants were not permitted. The primary end point was the first treated, adjudicated disease flare during the treatment period, assessed in a time-to-event analysis. Key secondary end points were the annualized flare rate and treatment-free and glucocorticoid-free complete remission. A total of 135 participants with IgG4-related disease underwent randomization: 68 participants were assigned to receive inebilizumab and 67 were assigned to receive placebo. Treatment with inebilizumab reduced flare risk; 7 participants (10%) in the inebilizumab group had at least one flare, as compared with 40 participants (60%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.28; P<0.001). The annualized flare rate was lower with inebilizumab than with placebo (rate ratio, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.31; P<0.001).

We performed a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which 2539 participants with obesity, of whom 1032 also had prediabetes, were assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive tirzepatide at a once-weekly dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or placebo. The current analysis involved the participants with both obesity and prediabetes, who received their assigned dose of tirzepatide or placebo for a total of 176 weeks, followed by a 17-week off-treatment period. The three key secondary end points, which were controlled for type I error, were the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 176 and onset of type 2 diabetes during the 176-week and 193-week periods. At 176 weeks, the mean percent change in body weight among the participants who received tirzepatide was -12.3% with the 5-mg dose, -18.7% with the 10-mg dose, and -19.7% with the 15-mg dose, as compared with -1.3% among those who received placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo).

An intraosseous route of drug administration may enable more rapid drug administration than an intravenous route; however, its effect on clinical outcomes is uncertain. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial across 11 emergency medical systems in the United Kingdom that involved adults in cardiac arrest for whom vascular access for drug administration was needed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment from paramedics by means of an intraosseous-first or intravenous-first vascular access strategy. The primary outcome was survival at 30 days. Key secondary outcomes included any return of spontaneous circulation and favorable neurologic function at hospital discharge (defined by a score of 3 or less on the modified Rankin scale, on which scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability). No adjustment for multiplicity was made. A total of 6082 patients were assigned to a trial group: 3040 to the intraosseous group and 3042 to the intravenous group. At 30 days, 137 of 3030 patients (4.5%) in the intraosseous group and 155 of 3034 (5.1%) in the intravenous group were alive (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.32; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74).

The efficacy and safety of the selective endothelin type A receptor antagonist atrasentan in reducing proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy are incompletely understood. We are conducting a phase 3, multinational, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving adults with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, a total urinary protein excretion of at least 1 g per day, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area. Patients were randomly assigned to receive atrasentan (0.75 mg per day) or matched placebo for 132 weeks. The primary outcome, assessed at a prespecified interim analysis of data from the first 270 patients in the main stratum, was the change in the 24-hour urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio from baseline to week 36; the change was estimated with the use of a repeated-measures model. (An exploratory stratum of patients who were receiving a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor were included in a separate analysis.) Safety analyses were based on adverse events across the entire main stratum. A total of 340 patients were recruited into the main stratum. Among the first 270 patients in the main stratum (135 per trial group) who completed the week 36 visit, the geometric mean percentage change in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio relative to baseline was significantly greater with atrasentan (-38.1%) than with placebo (-3.1%), with a geometric mean between-group difference of -36.1 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -44.6 to -26.4; P<0.001).

Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug. In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period. Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 40% in the placebo group). During the combined active- and post-trial periods, a primary-outcome event occurred in 865 of 3304 patients (26.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 1001 of 3305 patients (30.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.87). During the post-trial period only, the hazard ratio for a primary-outcome event was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99). During the combined periods, the risk of kidney disease progression was 23.5% in the empagliflozin group and 27.1% in the placebo group; the risk of the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease was 16.9% and 19.6%, respectively; and the risk of cardiovascular death was 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. There was no effect of empagliflozin on death from noncardiovascular causes (5.3% in both groups). In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease at risk for progression, empagliflozin continued to have additional cardiorenal benefits for up to 12 months after it was discontinued.

Iptacopan specifically binds to factor B and inhibits the alternative pathway. In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled adults with biopsy-confirmed IgA nephropathy and proteinuria with a 24-hour urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of 1 or higher (with protein and creatinine both measured in grams) despite optimized supportive therapy. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive oral iptacopan (200 mg) or placebo twice daily for 24 months while continuing to receive supportive therapy. The primary objective of this prespecified interim analysis was to assess the efficacy of iptacopan as compared with that of placebo in reducing proteinuria at month 9; the primary end point was the change from baseline in the 24-hour urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio at month 9. The proportion of patients who had a 24-hour urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of less than 1 at month 9 without receiving rescue or alternative medication or undergoing kidney-replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) was a secondary end point. Safety was also assessed. The effect of iptacopan on kidney function will be assessed at the end of the 2-year double-blind treatment period. The main trial population included 222 patients in the iptacopan group and 221 in the placebo group. The interim efficacy analysis included the first 250 patients who underwent randomization in the main trial population (125 patients in each group) and who remained in the trial until month 9 or discontinued the trial by month 9. Safety was assessed in all the patients in the main trial population. At month 9, the adjusted geometric mean 24-hour urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio was 38.3% (95% confidence interval, 26.0 to 48.6; two-sided P<0.001) lower with iptacopan than with placebo. The reduction in proteinuria was supported by consistent results in secondary end point analyses. There were no unexpected safety findings with iptacopan. The incidence of adverse events that occurred during the treatment period was similar in the two groups; most events were mild to moderate in severity and reversible. No increased risk of infection was observed.

The effect of microvascular inflammation on allograft outcomes is unclear. We conducted a cohort study that included kidney-transplant recipients from more than 30 transplantation centers in Europe and North America who had undergone allograft biopsy between 2004 and 2023. We integrated clinical and pathological data to classify biopsy specimens according to the 2022 Banff Classification of Renal Allograft Pathology, which includes two new diagnostic categories: probable antibody-mediated rejection and microvascular inflammation without evidence of an antibody-mediated response. We then assessed the association between the newly recognized microvascular inflammation phenotypes and allograft survival and disease progression. A total of 16,293 kidney-transplant biopsy specimens from 6798 patients were assessed. We identified the newly recognized microvascular inflammation phenotypes in 788 specimens, of which 641 were previously categorized as specimens with no evidence of rejection. As compared with patients without rejection, the hazard ratio for graft loss was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 3.1) among patients with microvascular inflammation without evidence of an antibody-mediated response and 2.7 (95% CI, 2.2 to 3.3) among patients with antibody-mediated rejection. Patients with a diagnosis of probable antibody-mediated rejection had a higher risk of graft failure beyond year 5 after biopsy than those without rejection (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.5). Patients with a diagnosis of either newly recognized microvascular inflammation phenotype had a higher risk of progression of transplant glomerulopathy during follow-up than patients without microvascular inflammation. Microvascular inflammation in kidney allografts includes distinct phenotypes, with various disease progression and allograft outcomes.

NTLA-2002 targets the gene encoding kallikrein B1 (KLKB1). A single dose of NTLA-2002 may provide lifelong control of angioedema attacks. In this phase 2 portion of a phase 1-2 trial, we randomly assigned adults with hereditary angioedema in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive NTLA-2002 in a single dose of 25 mg or 50 mg or placebo. The primary end point was the number of angioedema attacks per month (the monthly attack rate) from week 1 through week 16. Secondary end points included safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics (i.e., the change from baseline in total plasma kallikrein protein level); exploratory end points included patient-reported outcomes. Of the 27 patients who underwent randomization, 10 received 25 mg of NTLA-2002, 11 received 50 mg, and 6 received placebo.

Secondary outcomes included overall survival, survival without graft loss, rejection, infection, cancer, and HIV superinfection.

However, brentuximab vedotin increases the toxic effects of treatment in adults, more than half of pediatric patients who receive the drug undergo consolidative radiation, and relapse remains a challenge. Programmed death 1 blockade is effective in Hodgkin's lymphoma, including in preliminary studies involving previously untreated patients. We conducted a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial involving patients at least 12 years of age with stage III or IV newly diagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive brentuximab vedotin with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (BV+AVD) or nivolumab with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (N+AVD). Prespecified patients could receive radiation therapy directed to residual metabolically active lesions. The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of progressive disease or death from any cause. Of 994 patients who underwent randomization, 970 were included in the intention-to-treat population for efficacy analyses. At the second planned interim analysis, with a median follow-up of 12.1 months, the threshold for efficacy was crossed, indicating that N+AVD significantly improved progression-free survival as compared with BV+AVD (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.48; 99% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.87; two-sided P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Owing to the short follow-up time, we repeated the analysis with longer follow-up; with a median follow-up of 2.1 years (range, 0 to 4.2 years), the 2-year progression-free survival was 92% (95% CI, 89 to 94) with N+AVD, as compared with 83% (95% CI, 79 to 86) with BV+AVD (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.65). Overall, 7 patients received radiation therapy. Immune-related adverse events were infrequent with nivolumab; brentuximab vedotin was associated with more treatment discontinuation. N+AVD resulted in longer progression-free survival than BV+AVD in adolescents and adults with stage III or IV advanced-stage classic Hodgkin's lymphoma and had a better side-effect profile.

We performed integration-site analysis, genetic studies, flow cytometry, and morphologic studies in peripheral-blood and bone marrow samples from patients who received eli-cel therapy in two completed phase 2-3 studies (ALD-102 and ALD-104) and an ongoing follow-up study (LTF-304) involving the patients in both ALD-102 and ALD-104.

Comparisons of the effectiveness of these treatments have been limited. We performed an unblinded, multicenter, pragmatic, two-group, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial comparing collagenase injection with limited fasciectomy in persons with moderate Dupuytren's contracture. The primary outcome was the score on the Patient Evaluation Measure-Hand Health Profile (PEM), a questionnaire for assessing hand health as reported by the patient, at 1 year after treatment. Scores on the PEM range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. The prespecified noninferiority margin was 6 points.

The primary analysis included 599 persons: 314 in the collagenase group and 285 in the limited-fasciectomy group.

We assessed whether the immunogenicity of fractional doses of the 10-valent&#xa0;and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10 [GSK] and PCV13 [Pfizer], respectively) would be noninferior to that of the full doses and analyzed the prevalence of vaccine-serotype carriage. We randomly assigned healthy infants in Kenya to one of seven equal-sized trial groups. Participants in groups A through F were assigned to receive either a fractional or full dose of PCV10 or PCV13, administered as two primary doses plus one booster dose. In group A, participants received a full dose of PCV13; group B, a 40% dose of PCV13; group C, a 20% dose of PCV13; group D, a full dose of PCV10; group E, a 40% dose of PCV10; and group F, a 20% dose of PCV10. Participants in the seventh group (group G) received a full dose of PCV10 as three primary doses without a booster. Immunogenicity was assessed 4 weeks after the primary series of doses and 4 weeks after the booster dose. Noninferiority could be declared 4 weeks after the primary series if the difference in the percentage of participants with a threshold response was not more than 10% and 4 weeks after administration of the booster if the ratio of the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of IgG was more than 0.5. A vaccine dose was prespecified as noninferior if it met the noninferiority criterion for at least 8 of the 10 vaccine types in the PCV10 groups or at least 10 of the 13 vaccine types in the PCV13 groups. Carriage was assessed when participants were 9 months and 18 months of age. In the per-protocol analysis, 40% of a full dose of PCV13 met the noninferiority criterion for 12 of 13 serotypes after the primary series and for 13 of 13 serotypes after the booster. The immunogenicity of the 20% dose of PCV13 and of the 40% and 20% doses of PCV10 was not noninferior to that of the full doses. The prevalence of vaccine-serotype carriage was similar across the PCV13 groups at 9 months and 18 months of age.

Men 18 to 65 years of age with hemophilia B and a factor IX level of 2% or less were eligible for screening if they had received at least 6 months of therapy with prophylactic factor IX concentrate. The primary end point, tested for noninferiority, was the annualized bleeding rate (treated and untreated bleeding episodes) from week 12 to month 15 after treatment with fidanacogene elaparvovec as compared with the prophylaxis lead-in period. Superiority, additional efficacy end points, and safety were also assessed. Of 316 men who underwent screening for the lead-in study, 204 (64.6%) were not eligible; 188 (59.5%) of those were ineligible owing to the presence of anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies. Of the 45 participants who received fidanacogene elaparvovec, 44 completed at least 15 months of follow-up. The annualized rate of bleeding for all bleeding episodes decreased by 71%, from 4.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80 to 7.05) at baseline to 1.28 (95% CI, 0.57 to 1.98) after gene therapy, a treatment difference of -3.15 episodes (95% CI, -5.46 to -0.83; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). This result shows the noninferiority and superiority of fidanacogene elaparvovec to prophylaxis. At 15 months, the mean factor IX activity was 26.9% (median, 22.9%; range, 1.9 to 119.0) by one-stage SynthASil assay. A total of 28 participants (62%) received glucocorticoids for increased aminotransferase levels or decreased factor IX levels (or both) starting between 11 and 123 days. No infusion-related serious adverse events, thrombotic events, development of factor IX inhibitors, or malignant conditions were observed. Fidanacogene elaparvovec was superior to prophylaxis for the treatment of participants with hemophilia B, leading to reduced bleeding and stable factor IX expression.

In a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in China, we enrolled participants 1 to 24 months of age who were hospitalized with RSV infection. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive ziresovir (at a dose of 10 to 40 mg, according to body weight) or placebo, administered twice daily, for 5 days. The primary end point was the change from baseline to day 3 (defined as 48 hours after the first administration) in the Wang bronchiolitis clinical score (total scores range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater severity of signs and symptoms). The intention-to-treat population included all the participants with RSV-confirmed infection who received at least one dose of ziresovir or placebo; the safety population included all the participants who received at least one dose of ziresovir or placebo.

In a population-based trial that started in 2015, we invited men who were 50 to 60 years of age to undergo prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Men with a PSA level of 3 ng per milliliter or higher underwent MRI of the prostate. Men were randomly assigned to the systematic biopsy group, in which they underwent systematic biopsy and, if suspicious lesions were found on MRI, targeted biopsy, or the MRI-targeted biopsy group, in which they underwent MRI-targeted biopsy only. At each visit, men were invited for repeat screening 2, 4, or 8 years later, depending on the PSA level. The primary outcome was detection of clinically insignificant (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade 1) prostate cancer; detection of clinically significant (ISUP grade &#x2265;2) cancer was a secondary outcome, and detection of clinically advanced or high-risk (metastatic or ISUP grade 4 or 5) cancer was also assessed. After a median follow-up of 3.9 years (approximately 26,000 person-years in each group), prostate cancer had been detected in 185 of the 6575 men (2.8%) in the MRI-targeted biopsy group and 298 of the 6578 men (4.5%) in the systematic biopsy group. The relative risk of detecting clinically insignificant cancer in the MRI-targeted biopsy group as compared with the systematic biopsy group was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.57; P<0.001) and was lower at repeat rounds of screening than in the first round (relative risk, 0.25 vs. 0.49); the relative risk of a diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.07). The number of advanced or high-risk cancers detected (by screening or as interval cancer) was 15 in the MRI-targeted biopsy group and 23 in the systematic biopsy group (relative risk, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.24). Five severe adverse events occurred (three in the systematic biopsy group and two in the MRI-targeted biopsy group). In this trial, omitting biopsy in patients with negative MRI results eliminated more than half of diagnoses of clinically insignificant prostate cancer, and the associated risk of having incurable cancer diagnosed at screening or as interval cancer was very low.

The primary clinical manifestation is epistaxis that results in iron-deficiency anemia and reduced health-related quality of life. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide for the treatment of HHT. We randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive pomalidomide at a dose of 4 mg daily or matching placebo for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline through week 24 in the Epistaxis Severity Score (a validated bleeding score in HHT; range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse bleeding). A reduction of 0.71 points or more is considered clinically significant. A key secondary outcome was the HHT-specific quality-of-life score (range, 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating more limitations). The trial was closed to enrollment in June 2023 after a planned interim analysis met a prespecified threshold for efficacy. A total of 144 patients underwent randomization; 95 patients were assigned to receive pomalidomide and 49 to receive placebo. The baseline mean (&#xb1;SD) Epistaxis Severity Score was 5.0&#xb1;1.5, a finding consistent with moderate-to-severe epistaxis.

In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 12-week trial, we assigned patients with cancer cachexia and an elevated serum GDF-15 level (&#x2265;1500 pg per milliliter) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive ponsegromab at a dose of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg or to receive placebo, administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for three doses. The primary end point was the change from baseline in body weight at 12 weeks. Key secondary end points were appetite and cachexia symptoms, digital measures of physical activity, and safety. A total of 187 patients underwent randomization. Of these patients, 40% had non-small-cell lung cancer, 32% had pancreatic cancer, and 29% had colorectal cancer. At 12 weeks, patients in the ponsegromab groups had significantly greater weight gain than those in the placebo group, with a median between-group difference of 1.22 kg (95% credible interval, 0.37 to 2.25) in the 100-mg group, 1.92 (95% credible interval, 0.92 to 2.97) in the 200-mg group, and 2.81 (95% credible interval, 1.55 to 4.08) in the 400-mg group. Improvements were observed across measures of appetite and cachexia symptoms, along with physical activity, in the 400-mg ponsegromab group relative to placebo. Adverse events of any cause were reported in 70% of the patients in the ponsegromab group and in 80% of those in the placebo group. Among patients with cancer cachexia and elevated GDF-15 levels, the inhibition of GDF-15 with ponsegromab resulted in increased weight gain and overall activity level and reduced cachexia symptoms, findings that confirmed the role of GDF-15 as a driver of cachexia.

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive efsitora or degludec. The primary end point was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 52; we hypothesized that efsitora would be noninferior to degludec (noninferiority margin, 0.4 percentage points). Secondary and safety end points included the change in the glycated hemoglobin level in subgroups of participants using and not using glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, the percentage of time that the glucose level was in the target range of 70 to 180 mg per deciliter in weeks 48 through 52, and hypoglycemic episodes.

More information about the usefulness of these biomarkers for predicting cardiovascular risk over longer periods of time in women is needed because early-life intervention represents an important risk-reduction method. We measured high-sensitivity CRP, LDL cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) levels at baseline in 27,939 initially healthy U.S. women who were subsequently followed for 30 years. The primary end point was a first major adverse cardiovascular event, which was a composite of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. We calculated the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals across quintiles of each biomarker, along with 30-year cumulative incidence curves adjusted for age and competing risks. The mean age of the participants at baseline was 54.7 years. During the 30-year follow-up, 3662 first major cardiovascular events occurred. Quintiles of increasing baseline levels of high-sensitivity CRP, LDL cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) all predicted 30-year risks. Covariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the primary end point in a comparison of the top with the bottom quintile were 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52 to 1.90) for high-sensitivity CRP, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.23 to 1.52) for LDL cholesterol, and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.47) for lipoprotein(a). Findings for coronary heart disease and stroke appeared to be consistent with those for the primary end point. Each biomarker showed independent contributions to overall risk. The greatest spread for risk was obtained in models that incorporated all three biomarkers. A single combined measure of high-sensitivity CRP, LDL cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) levels among initially healthy U.S. women was predictive of incident cardiovascular events during a 30-year period.

At the first interim analysis (median follow-up, 18.4 months), the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months in both groups; at 18 months, 24.0% of the participants in the belzutifan group and 8.3% in the everolimus group were alive and free of progression (two-sided P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002, which met the prespecified significance criterion). A confirmed objective response occurred in 21.9% of the participants (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8 to 26.5) in the belzutifan group and in 3.5% (95% CI, 1.9 to 5.9) in the everolimus group (P<0.001, which met the prespecified significance criterion). At the second interim analysis (median follow-up, 25.7 months), the median overall survival was 21.4 months in the belzutifan group and 18.1 months in the everolimus group; at 18 months, 55.2% and 50.6% of the participants, respectively, were alive (hazard ratio for death, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.07; two-sided P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.20, which did not meet the prespecified significance criterion). Grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 61.8% of the participants in the belzutifan group (grade 5 in 3.5%) and in 62.5% in the everolimus group (grade 5 in 5.3%). Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 5.9% and 14.7% of the participants, respectively. Belzutifan showed a significant benefit over everolimus with respect to progression-free survival and objective response in participants with advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma who had previously received immune checkpoint and antiangiogenic therapies. Belzutifan was associated with no new safety signals.

The World Health Organization recommended restricting distribution to infants 1 to 11 months of age to mitigate antimicrobial resistance, although this more limited treatment had not yet been tested. We randomly assigned rural communities in Niger to four twice-yearly distributions of azithromycin for children 1 to 59 months of age (child azithromycin group), four twice-yearly distributions of azithromycin for infants 1 to 11 months of age and placebo for children 12 to 59 months of age (infant azithromycin group), or placebo for children 1 to 59 months of age. Census workers who were not aware of the group assignments monitored mortality twice yearly over the course of 2 years. We assessed three primary community-level mortality outcomes (deaths per 1000 person-years), each examining a different age group and pairwise group comparison. A total of 1273 communities were randomly assigned to the child azithromycin group (1229 were included in the analysis), 773 to the infant azithromycin group (751 included in the analysis), and 954 to the placebo group (929 included in the analysis). Among 382,586 children, 419,440 person-years and 5503 deaths were recorded. Lower mortality among children 1 to 59 months of age was observed in the child azithromycin group (11.9 deaths per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.3 to 12.6) than in the placebo group (13.9 deaths per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 13.0 to 14.8) (representing 14% lower mortality with azithromycin; 95% CI, 7 to 22; P<0.001). Mortality among infants 1 to 11 months of age was not significantly lower in the infant azithromycin group (22.3 deaths per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 20.0 to 24.7) than in the placebo group (23.9 deaths per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 21.6 to 26.2) (representing 6% lower mortality with azithromycin; 95% CI, -8 to 19). Five serious adverse events were reported: three in the placebo group, one in the infant azithromycin group, and one in the child azithromycin group. Azithromycin distributions to children 1 to 59 months of age significantly reduced mortality and was more effective than treatment of infants 1 to 11 months of age.

The frequency of at-home use increased over time to compensate for gradual loss of control of an eye-gaze-tracking device, followed by a progressive decrease in use starting 6 years after implantation. At-home use ended when control of the brain-computer interface became unreliable. No signs of technical malfunction were found. Instead, the amplitude of neural signals declined, and computed tomographic imaging revealed progressive atrophy, which suggested that ALS-related neurodegeneration ultimately rendered the brain-computer interface ineffective after years of successful use, although alternative explanations are plausible.

Communication with brain-computer interfaces has been restricted by extensive training requirements and limited accuracy. A 45-year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with tetraparesis and severe dysarthria underwent surgical implantation of four microelectrode arrays into his left ventral precentral gyrus 5 years after the onset of the illness; these arrays recorded neural activity from 256 intracortical electrodes. We report the results of decoding his cortical neural activity as he attempted to speak in both prompted and unstructured conversational contexts. Decoded words were displayed on a screen and then vocalized with the use of text-to-speech software designed to sound like his pre-ALS voice. On the first day of use (25 days after surgery), the neuroprosthesis achieved 99.6% accuracy with a 50-word vocabulary. Calibration of the neuroprosthesis required 30 minutes of cortical recordings while the participant attempted to speak, followed by subsequent processing. On the second day, after 1.4 additional hours of system training, the neuroprosthesis achieved 90.2% accuracy using a 125,000-word vocabulary. With further training data, the neuroprosthesis sustained 97.5% accuracy over a period of 8.4 months after surgical implantation, and the participant used it to communicate in self-paced conversations at a rate of approximately 32 words per minute for more than 248 cumulative hours. In a person with ALS and severe dysarthria, an intracortical speech neuroprosthesis reached a level of performance suitable to restore conversational communication after brief training.

This phenomenon, known as cognitive motor dissociation, has not been systematically studied in a large cohort of persons with disorders of consciousness. In this prospective cohort study conducted at six international centers, we collected clinical, behavioral, and task-based fMRI and EEG data from a convenience sample of 353 adults with disorders of consciousness. We assessed the response to commands on task-based fMRI or EEG in participants without an observable response to verbal commands (i.e., those with a behavioral diagnosis of coma, vegetative state, or minimally conscious state-minus) and in participants with an observable response to verbal commands. The presence or absence of an observable response to commands was assessed with the use of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). Data from fMRI only or EEG only were available for 65% of the participants, and data from both fMRI and EEG were available for 35%. The median age of the participants was 37.9 years, the median time between brain injury and assessment with the CRS-R was 7.9 months (25% of the participants were assessed with the CRS-R within 28 days after injury), and brain trauma was an etiologic factor in 50%. We detected cognitive motor dissociation in 60 of the 241 participants (25%) without an observable response to commands, of whom 11 had been assessed with the use of fMRI only, 13 with the use of EEG only, and 36 with the use of both techniques. Cognitive motor dissociation was associated with younger age, longer time since injury, and brain trauma as an etiologic factor. In contrast, responses on task-based fMRI or EEG occurred in 43 of 112 participants (38%) with an observable response to verbal commands. Approximately one in four participants without an observable response to commands performed a cognitive task on fMRI or EEG as compared with one in three participants with an observable response to commands.

Nipocalimab, an anti-neonatal Fc receptor blocker, inhibits transplacental IgG transfer and lowers maternal IgG levels. In an international, open-label, single-group, phase 2 study, we assessed treatment with intravenous nipocalimab (30 or 45 mg per kilogram of body weight per week) administered from 14 to 35 weeks' gestation in participants with pregnancies at high risk for recurrent early-onset severe HDFN. The primary end point was live birth at 32 weeks' gestation or later without intrauterine transfusions as assessed against a historical benchmark (0%; clinically meaningful difference, 10%). Live birth at 32 weeks' gestation or later without intrauterine transfusions occurred in 7 of 13 pregnancies (54%; 95% confidence interval, 25 to 81) in the study. No cases of fetal hydrops occurred, and 6 participants (46%) did not receive any antenatal or neonatal transfusions. Six fetuses received an intrauterine transfusion: five fetuses at 24 weeks' gestation or later and one fetus before fetal loss at 22 weeks and 5 days' gestation. Live birth occurred in 12 pregnancies. The median gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks and 4 days. Of the 12 live-born infants, 1 received one exchange transfusion and one simple transfusion and 5 received only simple transfusions. Treatment-related decreases in the alloantibody titer and IgG level were observed in maternal samples and cord blood. No unusual maternal or pediatric infections were observed. Serious adverse events were consistent with HDFN, pregnancy, or prematurity. Nipocalimab treatment delayed or prevented fetal anemia or intrauterine transfusions, as compared with the historical benchmark, in pregnancies at high risk for early-onset severe HDFN.

The addition of blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager molecule that is approved for the treatment of relapsed, refractory, and MRD-positive BCP-ALL, may have efficacy in patients with MRD-negative remission. In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients 30 to 70 years of age with BCR::ABL1-negative BCP-ALL (with :: indicating fusion) who had MRD-negative remission (defined as <0.01% leukemic cells in bone marrow as assessed on flow cytometry) after induction and intensification chemotherapy to receive four cycles of blinatumomab in addition to four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy or to receive four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy alone. The primary end point was overall survival, and relapse-free survival was a secondary end point. The data and safety monitoring committee reviewed the results from the third efficacy interim analysis and recommended that they be reported. Complete remission with or without full count recovery was observed in 395 of 488 enrolled patients (81%). Of the 224 patients with MRD-negative status, 112 were assigned to each group. The characteristics of the patients were balanced between the groups. At a median follow-up of 43 months, an advantage was observed in the blinatumomab group as compared with the chemotherapy-only group with regard to overall survival (at 3 years: 85% vs. 68%; hazard ratio for death, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.73; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and the 3-year relapse-free survival was 80% with blinatumomab and 64% with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio for relapse or death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.87). A higher incidence of neuropsychiatric events was reported in the blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy-only group.

We assessed the efficacy of lenacapavir and F/TAF by comparing the incidence of HIV infection with the estimated background incidence in the screened population and evaluated relative efficacy as compared with F/TDF. Among 5338 participants who were initially HIV-negative, 55 incident HIV infections were observed: 0 infections among 2134 participants in the lenacapavir group (0 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00 to 0.19), 39 infections among 2136 participants in the F/TAF group (2.02 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 1.44 to 2.76), and 16 infections among 1068 participants in the F/TDF group (1.69 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 0.96 to 2.74).

Data on outcomes of efanesoctocog alfa treatment in children younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A are limited. We conducted a phase 3, open-label study involving previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received prophylaxis with once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa (50 IU per kilogram of body weight) for 52 weeks.

The two primary end points, which were tested sequentially, were clinical remission at week 24 (defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of <150 [range, 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity]), which was analyzed in the first 50% of patients to complete the week 24 visit, with a noninferiority margin of 10 percentage points; and endoscopic remission at week 48 (defined as a score of &#x2264;4, a decrease of &#x2265;2 points from baseline, and no subscore >1 in any individual variable on the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease [range, 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating more severe disease]), which was analyzed for superiority in 100% of the patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of risankizumab or ustekinumab. In the full intention-to-treat population for the efficacy analysis, 230 of 255 patients (90.2%) who received risankizumab and 193 of 265 patients (72.8%) who received ustekinumab completed all the assigned treatments. Both primary end points were met; risankizumab was noninferior to ustekinumab with respect to clinical remission at week 24 (58.6% vs. 39.5%; adjusted difference, 18.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6 to 30.3) and superior to ustekinumab with respect to endoscopic remission at week 48 (31.8% vs. 16.2%; adjusted difference, 15.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.4 to 22.9; P<0.001). The incidence of adverse events appeared to be similar in the two groups. In this head-to-head clinical trial of risankizumab and ustekinumab involving patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease who had had unacceptable side effects with anti-TNF therapy or an inadequate response to such therapy, risankizumab was noninferior to ustekinumab with respect to clinical remission at week 24 and superior with respect to endoscopic remission at week 48.

However, temporal changes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, including the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, may have affected the risk and burden of PASC. Whether the risk and burden of PASC have changed over the course of the pandemic is unclear. We used health records of the Department of Veterans Affairs to build a study population of 441,583 veterans with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2022, and 4,748,504 noninfected contemporaneous controls. We estimated the cumulative incidence of PASC at 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-delta, delta, and omicron eras of the Covid-19 pandemic. Among unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cumulative incidence of PASC during the first year after infection was 10.42 events per 100 persons (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.22 to 10.64) in the pre-delta era, 9.51 events per 100 persons (95% CI, 9.26 to 9.75) in the delta era, and 7.76 events per 100 persons (95% CI, 7.57 to 7.98) in the omicron era (difference between the omicron and pre-delta eras, -2.66 events per 100 persons [95% CI, -2.93 to -2.36]; difference between the omicron and delta eras, -1.75 events per 100 persons [95% CI, -2.08 to -1.42]). Among vaccinated persons, the cumulative incidence of PASC at 1 year was 5.34 events per 100 persons (95% CI, 5.10 to 5.58) during the delta era and 3.50 events per 100 persons (95% CI, 3.31 to 3.71) during the omicron era (difference between the omicron and delta eras, -1.83 events per 100 persons; 95% CI, -2.14 to -1.52). Vaccinated persons had a lower cumulative incidence of PASC at 1 year than unvaccinated persons (difference during the delta era, -4.18 events per 100 persons [95% CI, -4.47 to -3.88]; difference during the omicron era, -4.26 events per 100 persons [95% CI, -4.49 to -4.05]). Decomposition analyses showed 5.23 (95% CI, 4.97 to 5.47) fewer PASC events per 100 persons at 1 year during the omicron era than during the pre-delta and delta eras combined; 28.11% of the decrease (95% CI, 25.57 to 30.50) was attributable to era-related effects (changes in the virus and other temporal effects), and 71.89% (95% CI, 69.50 to 74.43) was attributable to vaccines. The cumulative incidence of PASC during the first year after SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased over the course of the pandemic, but the risk of PASC remained substantial even among vaccinated persons who had SARS-CoV-2 infection in the omicron era.&#xa0;(Supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs.).",2644,,0,eng,"Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",2026-01-11 18:49:29

Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody against RSV that has an extended half-life. Its postlicensure real-world effectiveness against RSV-associated bronchiolitis is unclear. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, matched case-control study to analyze the effectiveness of nirsevimab therapy against hospitalization for RSV-associated bronchiolitis in infants younger than 12 months of age. Case patients were infants younger than 12 months of age who were hospitalized for RSV-associated bronchiolitis between October 15 and December 10, 2023. Control patients were infants with clinical visits to the same hospitals for conditions unrelated to RSV infection. Case patients were matched to control patients in a 2:1 ratio on the basis of age, date of hospital visit, and study center. We calculated the effectiveness of nirsevimab therapy against hospitalization for RSV-associated bronchiolitis (primary outcome) by means of a multivariate conditional logistic-regression model with adjustment for confounders. Several sensitivity analyses were performed. The study included 1035 infants, of whom 690 were case patients (median age, 3.1 months; interquartile range, 1.8 to 5.3) and 345 were matched control patients (median age, 3.4 months; interquartile range, 1.6 to 5.6).

Sensitivity analyses gave results similar to those of the primary analysis.

The efficacy and safety of benralizumab in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis are unclear. In a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients 12 to 65 years of age with symptomatic and histologically active eosinophilic esophagitis in a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous benralizumab (30 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks. The two primary efficacy end points were histologic response (&#x2264;6 eosinophils per high-power field) and the change from baseline in the score on the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ; range, 0 to 84, with higher scores indicating more frequent or severe dysphagia) at week 24. A total of 211 patients underwent randomization: 104 were assigned to receive benralizumab, and 107 were assigned to receive placebo. At week 24, more patients had a histologic response with benralizumab than with placebo (87.4% vs. 6.5%; difference, 80.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 72.9 to 88.8; P<0.001). However, the change from baseline in the DSQ score did not differ significantly between the two groups (difference in least-squares means, 3.0 points; 95% CI, -1.4 to 7.4; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.18). There was no substantial between-group difference in the change from baseline in the Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score, which reflects endoscopic abnormalities. Adverse events were reported in 64.1% of the patients in the benralizumab group and in 61.7% of those in the placebo group. No patients discontinued the trial because of adverse events. In this trial involving patients 12 to 65 years of age with eosinophilic esophagitis, a histologic response (&#x2264;6 eosinophils per high-power field) occurred in significantly more patients in the benralizumab group than in the placebo group. However, treatment with benralizumab did not result in fewer or less severe dysphagia symptoms than placebo.

In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:2:1:1 ratio, patients 1 to 11 years of age with active eosinophilic esophagitis who had had no response to proton-pump inhibitors to 16 weeks of a higher-exposure or lower-exposure subcutaneous dupilumab regimen or to placebo (two groups) (Part A). At the end of Part A, eligible patients in each dupilumab group continued the same regimen and those in the placebo groups were assigned to higher-exposure or lower-exposure dupilumab for 36 weeks (Part B). At each level of exposure, dupilumab was administered in one of four doses tiered according to baseline body weight. The primary end point was histologic remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count, &#x2264;6 per high-power field) at week 16. Key secondary end points were tested hierarchically. In Part A, histologic remission occurred in 25 of the 37 patients (68%) in the higher-exposure group, in 18 of the 31 patients (58%) in the lower-exposure group, and in 1 of the 34 patients (3%) in the placebo group (difference between the higher-exposure regimen and placebo, 65 percentage points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 48 to 81; P<0.001]; difference between the lower-exposure regimen and placebo, 55 percentage points [95% CI, 37 to 73; P<0.001]). The higher-exposure dupilumab regimen led to significant improvements in histologic, endoscopic, and transcriptomic measures as compared with placebo. The improvements in histologic, endoscopic, and transcriptomic measures between baseline and week 52 in all the patients were generally similar to the improvements between baseline and week 16 in the patients who received dupilumab in Part A. In Part A, the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019, nausea, injection-site pain, and headache was at least 10 percentage points higher among the patients who received dupilumab (at either dose) than among those who received placebo. Serious adverse events were reported in 3 patients who received dupilumab during Part A and in 6 patients overall during Part B. Dupilumab resulted in histologic remission in a significantly higher percentage of children with eosinophilic esophagitis than placebo. The higher-exposure dupilumab regimen also led to improvements in measures of key secondary end points as compared with placebo.
